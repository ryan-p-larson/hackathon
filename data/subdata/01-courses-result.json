This course provides an overview of the observation and scientific research which have contributed to our current understanding of plant biology ranging all the way from the molecular level to the Earth's biosphere. Beginning with the basic structural and functional aspects of plant cells, tissues, and organs, the class integrates fundamental aspects of plant biochemistry such as photosynthesis, respiration, mineral nutrition, and growth requirements. Basic genetics is presented from a botanical perspective including the reproductive biology of flowering plants and the pioneering work of Mendel through present-day understanding of DNA structure and function, mutation, evolution, and plant biotechnology. The course also provides a brief survey of plant diversity and evolution spanning some 3 1/2 billion years of history from the origin of life and the oldest algal forms through the evolution of flowering plants. There are two and one half hours of lecture and two hours of lab per week. We will also utilize the rooftop greenhouse in adjacent BBE for several of our meetings.\r\nGrades are based on selected assignments, two exams (with lecture and lab portions), and the comprehensive final exam. Purchase of the textbook (Biology of Plants, 7th edition, by Raven et al, 2005) is highly recommended; copies of this and related useful references will also be available at the Biology Library reference desk.", "requirements": "one year of high school chemistry", "href": "http://catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu/my-ui/courses/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=OOMYHWEkkSlZ-DiaEw8kEmGT2BO6F0Rn&q.courseSubject=BIOL&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=1261"},

How multicellular animals develop has long been a central area of study in the biological sciences. Technological innovations in recent years have stimulated a virtual explosion of new information and conceptual breakthroughs, providing molecular mechanisms for fundamental developmental processes. The object of this course is to provide an intellectual foundation for understanding the current research literature in developmental biology through in-depth analysis of selected systems. As noted in the course title, a major emphasis is to explore the genetic regulation of developmental pathways and processes. However, organismal, cellular, and biochemical perspectives are discussed when appropriate. The course provides an in-depth examination of topics in pattern formation, cell fate specification, and differentiation. Readings are primarily from research articles and reviews, providing a particularly detailed study of selected processes, in development, drawing on examples primarily from Drosophila and vertebrate systems. Emphasis is on understanding development through molecular genetic technologies. Attendance is required.

How multicellular animals develop has long been a central area of study in the biological sciences. Technological innovations in recent years have stimulated a virtual explosion of new information and conceptual breakthroughs, providing molecular mechanisms for fundamental developmental processes. The object of this course is to provide an intellectual foundation for understanding the current research literature in developmental biology through in-depth analysis of selected systems. As noted in the course title, a major emphasis is to explore the genetic regulation of developmental pathways and processes. However, organismal, cellular, and biochemical perspectives are discussed when appropriate. The course provides an in-depth examination of topics in pattern formation, cell fate specification, and differentiation. Readings are primarily from research articles and reviews, providing a particularly detailed study of selected processes, in development, drawing on examples primarily from Drosophila and vertebrate systems. Emphasis is on understanding development through molecular genetic technologies. Attendance is required. Grades are based on three take-home exams.", "requirements": null, "href": "http://catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu/my-ui/courses/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=57GJcmdFTMZ6pRKLnjKKR1ycsjH7j3ee&q.courseSubject=BIOL&q.sessionId=68&q.courseNumber=4333"},
