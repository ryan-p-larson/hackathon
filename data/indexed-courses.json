Its caves, limestone formations, and rugged bluffs provide visitors a chance to \"step back\" into geological time thousands of years. Caves are all different sizes and shapes. Some can be explored by walking while others can best be seen by crawling. In any case, a flashlight or headlamp and old clothes and shoes are most helpful. The park contains more caves than any other state park in Iowa. A beautiful trail system links the caves, formations, and overlooks while providing an exciting hiking experience. Trail highlights include the dramatic \"Natural Bridge\" which stands nearly 50 feet above Raccoon Creek, and the 17-ton \"Balanced Rock\".\nThe class will leave Iowa City on Friday afternoon, camp at Maquoketa Caves State Park over the weekend, and return to campus on Sunday afternoon. Friday's departure time will be coordinated around students' class schedules. The course fee covers camping equipment, park fees, meals while camping, and transportation. Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. Students will be expected to wear appropriate footwear and clothing.  The instructor will discuss what footwear and clothing is appropriate for this course at the Wednesday evening meeting.",

    "description": "This class travels to the Driftless Area of northeastern Iowa to explore Effigy Mounds National Monument. The Effigy Moundbuilders inhabited the Upper Mississippi River Valley in Northeast Iowa, Southeast Minnesota, Southwest Wisconsin, and Northwest Illinois during the Late Woodland period - which is when the Effigy Mound Culture occurs, beginning around 350 A.D. and continuing in northeast Iowa until about 1300 A.D. The animal shaped mounds found at the national monument are thought to have started around 600 AD and continued until the end of the Late Woodland period. The rugged, deeply carved terrain seen in the “Paleozoic Plateau” of Northeast Iowa is so unlike the remainder of the state that the contrast is unmistakable. It is this bedrock dominated terrain that sparked Samuel Calvin, one of Iowa’s best known nineteenth-century geologists to speak of these unexpectedly scenic landscapes as the “Switzerland of Iowa.” See: http://www.nps.gov/efmo/ for details regarding the unique geology, biology, and botany of Effigy Mounds National Monument and surrounding areas. Trails will vary in difficulty, and students must be prepared to hike over 7 miles in a day. Students should be prepared to hike and camp in hot, cold, windy, or rainy weather.\nThe class will leave Iowa City on Friday afternoon, camp at Yellow River State Forest over the weekend, and return to campus on Sunday afternoon.

This course explores how the vacation has changed from an activity exclusive to the upper classes – the “leisure” class – to an expectation shared by all Americans.\nIn this class we will visit a variety of American vacation sites: our first popular vacation destination, Niagara Falls; resorts for the wealthy such as Newport, Rhode Island, and resorts for the middle class such as Atlantic City; the Jewish resorts of the Catskills and African American resorts such as Idlewild and Sag Harbor; historic sites such as Gettysburg; amusement parks like Coney Island; theme parks like Disneyland; the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 and the Iowa State Fair; the national parks of the American west, and the great middle class family vacation tradition – the road trip. We will learn about these places and their meanings in the American imagination by reading memoirs of famous American vacationers from Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman and Mary Roberts Rinehart to Henry Miller, Jamaica Kincaid and Colson Whitehead.\nThe main project for the semester is to explore the vacation memoirs of your own family and place them within the context of the broader patterns of American vacations throughout history. During the semester you will write up your own recollections and interview your parents and grandparents about their experiences. Grades will be based on a midterm and final exam, the vacation memoir project consisting of three intermediary reports and the final paper, and active discussion throughout the semester.",

We will view each film in terms of the stories it tells, the values it appears to promote, the historical contexts it references (both sport and society more generally), and the ways different aspects of filmmaking influence our viewing experience.  \nWe will screen 15 films over the course of the semester, selecting from classics such as Rocky, Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, and A League of their Own and from more complicated films like Raging Bull, Girlfight, and Big Fan. We will see one film each week, preceded by a lecture that introduces the film and draws connections between the film and the assigned readings. Most weeks, students write a two-page review of the film; some weeks students write a review comparing two films. There are no exams. Grades will be determined by the film reviews, active participation in discussion sections, and a final paper which compares one film screened in class with two other films of the student’s choosing.",

    "description": "Baseball is one of the most enduringly popular cultural activities in US life. Since the late 19th century, baseball has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand “America.” By taking baseball seriously as a cultural practice, we can better understand how and why it has shaped and been shaped by broader cultural forces of which it is a part. We will pursue this aim by examining how the practice has been constructed and to understand it as a site of struggles to define American life. In this course, we will consider the theme of cultural struggle by focusing on the following questions: Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from baseball’s past been remembered and re-imagined? What is considered scandalous and why? What has success in baseball been defined and redefined? The assignments for the course are designed to improve and refine your ability to think carefully about baseball as culture and to communicate your ideas clearly.",

    "description": "Sports’ meanings cannot be divorced from their mediated representation.  In fact, sports are most commonly experienced and consumed through some form of media.  Rather than merely “showing” us sports and sporting events, media create many of the values, ideas, feelings, and problems commonly connected to sports.  Media also compose a primary means through which sports are commodified and used as vehicles for advertising.  Sports cannot be properly understood, then, without taking into account their complex relationship to media—from early 20th century newsreels to contemporary fantasy sports.\nFocusing primarily on an American context, this course will investigate the varied meanings attached to sports; examine how sports media create and negotiate these cultural meanings; and probe sports media’s historical, institutional, political, economic, and aesthetic uses and implications.",

Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations.

Board black theater as the older extends the efforts of Lorraine Hansberry and the younger refines the strategies of Adrienne Kennedy.  Notwithstanding the differences in their creative works, these two playwrights ruled the last two decades of the 20th century with a thoroughness that is unprecedented in black theater history.  The Black Arts Movement may have propelled African American drama to widespread mainstream recognition; however, the string of Pulitzers and New York Drama Critics Circle Awards garnered by Wilson and Parks marks an unmatched degree of acclaim.  Gauging their impact on American society between the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

    "description": "This course will explore how and why American slavery begins, expands, becomes a subject of intense social debate and conflict, and finally, how and why slavery comes to an end during the Civil War. We explore the major national developments shaped by slavery, and we also explore the day-to-day experience of everyone whose lives were touched by slavery--women, children, and men who were bought and sold; people, slave and free, who resisted and rebelled against the practice of slavery; people who staked their family's future success on their ability to buy and profit from the purchase of one enslaved person.We begin by exploring the premise that U.S. history, through the aftermath of the Civil War, is at its core the story of slavery. The earliest laws of the American colonies sought to establish a legal practice of slavery; military strategy during the American Revolutionary War attempted to manipulate American investments in slavery; concerns about the rights of slaveholders influenced every major debate over the national constitution; the right to buy and sell other people became a part of how some Americans defined the meaning of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.In the second half of the course, we focus on the experience of enslaved Africans and African Americans, as they forged families and communities, battled for their rights to bodily integrity, created new American cultures, and brought their critique of slavery to the point of rebellion. We explore the impact of slavery on American ideas about race and racial hierarchies, and we consider the development of national conflicts over the practice, morality, and legality of slavery—culminating in the Civil War.  We also explore the memory and popular history of slavery.In addition to assigned readings and occasional homework assignments, course requirements include short, in-class quizzes; take-home midterm and final exams; and an eight-page research paper on a topic relating to the history of slavery in the U.S.",

    "description": "This course examines some of the pivotal works of late eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century African American literature. Throughout the semester, we will analyze the fictional representation of early African American life in the United States. We will also discuss: early versions of the African American novel; the black American’s transition from slavery to nominal freedom; male and female slave narratives; comparisons of the literary portrayals of black life in the North and the South; the controversies associated with racial passing; the role of “Negro” dialect in American and African American literature; literary and visual representations of lynching; and early cinematic representations of the black image. \nAmong the questions we will consider are: How did writers critique America’s discriminatory practices as well as intra-racial class and color prejudices? What were the influences of popular culture on the literature of the period? How did the Civil War and the continual threat of lynching affect black creative methods and philosophy? We will also look at the African American literary image created by other American writers such as Stephen Crane, Herman Melville, and Mark Twain, and the legal decisions and political compromises that affected the construction of African American personhood (such as the Dred Scott v. Sanford and the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decisions). There will be a significant focus on the writings of Charles Chesnutt, one of the most prolific early African American writers and an author who wrote in the 19th and early 20th centuries. \nReadings will be supplemented by films and audio recordings. Class requirements include quizzes, class participation, one paper, a mid-term, and a final exam.  \nReading list:\nPaul Laurence Dunbar, The Sport of the Gods• ISBN-10: 1614278261• ISBN-13: 978-1614278269Octavia Butler, Kindred• ISBN-10: 0807083690• ISBN-13: 978-0807083697John Hope Franklin, Three Negro Classics• ISBN-10: 0380015811• ISBN-13: 978-0380015818Herman Melville, Benito Cereno and Bartleby, ISBN:1619493799Charles Chesnutt, The Marrow of Tradition • ISBN-10: 1420937987• ISBN-13: 978-1420937985Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, Slave Narratives (Modern Library Edition), ASIN: B0043AWXVM",

    "description": "This course concentrates on Africa south of the Sahara. It surveys the major changes in this region over the 2000 years which preceded the onset of European colonial rule in the late 19th century. Thus it brings the story of African history up to 1880, the point at which European colonialism irrevocably changed the course of African social development. The course focuses on the major dynamics of economic and political change, including the development of states and large systems of trade. A major aspect of this history is the Atlantic slave trade. The course places the slave trade in the wider context of African political, economic and social history, and examines its impact on African societies. The course concludes by discussing the ways in which Africans living under European influence in the early colonial period interpreted their own past.\nThe study of African history has produced a particularly wide variety of views and interpretations.The purpose of this introductory course is to help studentsmake their own judgments about competing claims and conflicting interpretations of the African past. To this end, much of the course is devoted to examining competing interpretations and the evidence on which they are based. It discusses the major arguments which have developed among historians of Africa, and looks at how historians use archaeological, linguistic and documentary evidence. Above all, it discusses historians’ use of African oral tradition. As we will see, one of the most interesting aspects of African historical study is that it draws upon kinds of evidence which are rarely used by historians in other parts of the world, and so gives us an unusual perspective on the human past. Grades are based upon two exams, two writing assignments, and several quizzes.",

    "description": "This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n \nAs part of the University of Iowa’s “Big Ideas” curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the “Age of Petroleum,” an age in which we continue to live.\n \nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years? What were the factors behind oil’s emergence as the world’s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth’s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n \n \n \nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for “Historical Perspectives,” students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n \n \n \nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common.

    "description": "We as humans rely on ecosystem services, valuable goods and services produced by ecosystems such as recreational opportunities, flood control, food production, and water purification, for our well-being. Our activities alter ecosystems, however, and may thus alter these services, reducing our quality-of-life or, in some cases, our ability to survive. In this course we will examine ecosystem services from an interdisciplinary perspective centering on the geographic techniques used to understand, quantify, and predict ecosystem service delivery and how these techniques may be combined with those from other fields (e.g.., economics) to enable use to make ecosystem services a part of planning and policy-making. This course will have three main components: (1) an overview of ecosystem services and the processes that influence them; (2) an exploration of the techniques used to quantify, map, and model ecosystem services; and (3) an examination of the methods used to incorporate ecosystem services into decision and policy making. Instruction will consist of a mix of lecture, class discussion, and small-group and individual projects and computer-based laboratories.",

    "description": "This course has been designed to provide: (1) a broad, historical survey of how government has applied two major policy instruments, regulation and finance, in the transport sector; and (2) a more detailed, analytical review of recent and proposed changes in regulatory and financial policy as those policy revisions relate to social goals and transport agencies in the U.S. The regulatory emphasis is on transport environmental, social, and safety regulation, but attention also is given to economic regulatory measures. Although the geographic emphasis is the U.S., policies and practices of other countries are discussed for comparison, and international implications of transport change is investigated. It is assumed that students are acquainted in general with institutions and economic relationships in transportation (such as presented in the planning course 102:260), including the government instruments applied to influence market activities in intercity transport. The course builds upon this knowledge to explore recent developments in government investment and promotion practices, such as federal highway cost allocation studies and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\nThe initial portion of the course covers air, highway, and rail transport regulation and the effects of major changes in the economic regulation of those modes. Impacts on service to small communities and to persons with disabilities, the distribution of traffic among the modes, market structure, pricing and price discrimination, and innovation and technological change are discussed. Next students cover safety and environmental regulation, including transport security, environmental impact statements, environmental justice, nonattainment areas, and mitigation measures. An important current topic for investigation is the integration of environmental impact assessment in the transport planning process. In the second portion of the course, students explore finance principles, policies, and operations. Finally, students critically review proposals for change, such as revised transport programs (including state infrastructure banks, block grants, and intermodal trust funds); different methods of infrastructure finance and pricing (including possible roles for intelligent transportation systems); and privatization (including private operation of public facilities, contracts with private firms for facility maintenance, private construction and operation of toll facilities, and public-private partnerships for the joint development of land and transportation).\nStudents have the opportunity and responsibility for active participation in class discussion; each person should appear at class meetings prepared to contribute to a discussion of the week's readings. During the semester students are assigned to write approximately five policy memos, short research reports, or critiques of publications. A final exam is given, either in class at the assigned time, or as a take-home exam; the form is determined following the instructor's consultation with students. Evaluation of students' level of achievement in the course is based on demonstrated performance as follows: discussion and oral presentations (35%), papers and critiques (40%), and final exam (25%).\nAdditional instruction relating to Freight Transportation Planning will be added for students taking the 4 s.h. option. \nThere are no textbooks for this class.",

    "description": "A tsunami (Japanese for \"harbor wave\") is formed when a large volume of water is displaced in the ocean, typically by an earthquake. The displacement of the water generates long wavelength wave trains that have little effect in the open ocean, but can produce devastating coastal \"waves\" when they encounter land.  We will begin by examining the cause and effects of several catastrophic tsunamis such as the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami that devastated coastal areas of eastern Japan in 2011, the Indian Ocean Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004, the Good Friday Tsunami in 1964, and the April Fools Day Tsunami in 1946. The Boxing Day Tsunami is one of the largest natural disasters in recorded history. It produced waves 100 feet high that killed nearly 230,000 people in coastal areas throughout the Indian Ocean. The 2011 Tohoku Tsunami was also an unusually large tsunami, with waves up to 40 ft high, more than 19,000 deaths, and destruction of many coastal towns in eastern Japan. This tsunami also cut off power to the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which led to a major nuclear accident. More typical are the Good Friday Tsunami that struck Crescent City, California (289 buildings destroyed, 12 fatalities) and the April Fools Day Tsunami that struck Hilo, Hawaii, ($26 million damage, 159 deaths). Then we will discuss how accurate real-time forecasts of tsunamis are made, examine how tsunami hazards are assessed, review other less common causes of tsunamis, look at the social/economic impacts of tsunamis and examine how tsunamis are depicted in Hollywood movies.  The final weeks of class will be devoted to student presentations on a topic of their choice that somehow involves tsunamis.  Grades will be based on participation in discussions, short writing assignments, and the presentation.",

    "description": "This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n \nAs part of the University of Iowa’s “Big Ideas” curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the “Age of Petroleum,” an age in which we continue to live.\n \nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years? What were the factors behind oil’s emergence as the world’s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth’s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n \n \n \nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for “Historical Perspectives,” students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n \n \n \nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course.

Thus, geoscientists must use quantitative tools to extrapolate observations, relate them to unseen physical properties and phenomena, and constrain both measurement and model uncertainties. This course will introduce students to data inversion methods, time series analysis, noise characterization, and principal component analyses. Additionally, this course will provide a generalized introduction to scientific computing through the use of MATLAB and linear algebra.",

    "description": "If you think print is dead, think again! Readers across all age groups prefer to read alumni magazines in print, and, secondly, through a combination of both print and online. Alumni magazines are a highly visible representation of a school’s quality, both a mark of pride for alumni and point of distinction for prospective students.\nAlumni magazine writing is a mix of journalistic and public relations reporting and writing. It incorporates institutional messaging and has a strategic purpose. It is more than features; it is news briefs, class notes, and school and campus information. It is a tool to connect and engage alumni with thought-provoking, entertaining, and educational stories.\nThrough this course, you will learn about the many components of magazine production and acquire the tools necessary to succeed as an alumni magazine professional—a possible career choice for you! By the end of the course, you will research, write, design, and produce the School of Journalism and Mass Communication’s alumni magazine, the Iowa Journalist, with a circulation of 7,600. You will also develop an online edition, incorporating additional multimedia material, as well as create corresponding social media posts promoting the publication’s content.\nThere are many essential roles to bring the Iowa Journalist to fruition—not everyone will be a feature writer. We’ll function as a team to successfully accomplish its production. Roles include: Associate Editor, Feature Writer, General Assignment Writer, Web Specialist, Social Media Specialist, Graphics Specialist, and Photographer/Videographer.",

    "description": "Editing is a creative, intellectually stimulating and rewarding process. Good editors are critical thinkers, able to see the big picture as well as the small details. They are aware of news developments and current events. They can make sound ethical and legal decisions. Good managers, they also are capable of coaching staff to produce their best. Today's editors also are the hub of multi-media storytelling - or media convergence in popular terms. This class will focus on this contemporary role of editors.\nStudents also will learn the basics of micro and macro editing. Micro editing involves text editing for accuracy and clarity, with an emphasis on grammar, punctuation, spelling, syntax, style; it includes headline and cutline writing, as well as articles. Macro editing is concerned with the big picture. It involves story organization, presentation, focus and objective. It requires developing ethical news judgment, an understanding of the audience, inclusive coverage, cultural awareness, and a general sense of what makes a good story. Course work emphasizes student participation.",

Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations.

The experience can provide a general overview of a given museum operation, or when the student's interests may be better served by specialized museological training, areas of concentration can be pursued.  A formal internship agreement is established between the sponsoring museum, the student, the UI Career Center, and the UI Museum Studies faculty which stipulates the duties and objectives of the internship.  Accountability as well as evaluation of the internship are maintained through separate reports prepared by both the intern and the sponsoring museum's staff supervisor pursuant to the originally stated objectives.  These reports are in turn evaluated by the UI Museum Studies faculty.  In special cases when individual circumstances would prevent travel to an external museum, an internship can be arranged at a University of Iowa museum.If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.",

We will survey famous works from the earliest days of archaic Greece, the rise and fall of classical Athens, and the Hellenistic kingdoms. We will read broadly, including the epic poetry of Homer, Athenian theater, the origins of western historiography and philosophy. We will explore the problems of culture and ‘culturedness’ that are tangled up in the practice of reading of these texts (that is, reception) and our class discussions will necessarily entangle contemporary and historical issues, attitudes, and politics. Through these texts we will wrestle with the problematic categories of genre, canon, value, truth, and beauty. We will examine the role of the reader in reading, consider how literature can be used, and practice the development, articulation, and examination of personal opinion and response. The student will gain a broad exposure to the literature of ancient Greece and an appreciation for why it has been (and is still) read. Lectures will include brief introductions on Greek civilization, culture, and life. Writing assignments will encourage students to develop self-awareness as readers, and to practice articulating and supporting personalized reactions to, and opinions about, literary works.",

    "description": "We may not all believe that it’s better to have love and lost than never to have loved at all, but the experience of love is hard to imagine without the experience of loss. This course will look at the human experience of love, loss, and longing across a wide variety of traditions and time periods. The idea will be to glance into a number of literatures without having to identify a single thread or story among them other than our own responses and reflections. This will be an exercise in reading for better living, in learning a bit about how others have thought about love and loss in order to expand our own ways of seeing the world. There won’t be any books to purchase. The readings will be available online. We will work on paying close attention to short texts through simple readings. Our aim will always be to engage the imagination. There will be a series of shorter written assignments, an oral presentation, and a final written project. Some of the readings will be drawn from the likes of Homer, Sappho (the only ancient Greek female poet we know by name), Plato, the anonymous authors of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, the (also anonymous) early Spanish-language texts known as jarchas, the Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus, the Medieval troubadour poets of southern France, Baroque Spanish and Italian verse, and the writings of the great seventeenth-century Mexican nun Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. We’ll think a bit about different kinds of love, what it means to feel so strongly the presence of something that no longer exists or that is far away, about the nature of life, death, joy, sorrow, that sort of thing. Along the way we’ll also pause to consider what it means to read things in translation, what it means to read a text of something which was originally meant for oral performance, and how it is that some things have survived the ages and come down to us as important.",

We will study the origins of English words and especially the Latin components that make up the majority of English words—sixty percent of all words and ninety percent of those over two syllables. We also will look closely at three tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, tracing adaptations of Midas, Pyramus and Thisbe, and Pygmalion from antiquity to the present day in poetry, drama, art, and film.\nClass will be a combination of lecture, discussion, video clips, writing exercises, and word games. Some of the writing assignments will be creative, some will be more traditional, but all will be related to what we have just read or viewed. In order to focus on writing at the word and sentence level, the emphasis will be on shorter writing efforts as opposed to long papers. Grades will be based on writing assignments, quizzes, and three exams.\nTranslations of Ovid, Stanley Lombardo’s in particular, will serve as a point of departure. Other readings/viewings will include the works of canonical authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Shaw, as well as those of present-day poets, playwrights, and filmmakers. We also will examine how the English language has changed over time and how an author’s background (era, culture, race, gender, etc.) may have influenced different adaptations of the same story.\nSatisfies one of the requirements for the Undergraduate Certificate in Writing.",

This course takes a look at some heroes, heroines, and gods of Rome, in the context of the legends and rituals that were associated with them. We will also examine a few of the more strange Roman deities, and some Roman rituals, like the Lupercalia. When Julius Caesar and Mark Antony celebrated the Lupercalia, Romans were scandalized and many have thought it led directly to Caesar’s assassination. The purpose of this course is to give students an introduction to significant mythical and historical figures of Roman culture and their legends, and to provide experience in identifying themes that link these legends. Students will also develop ideas about what constitutes “Roman values” and will write about them. It is an excellent preparation for the study of ancient Mediterranean history, European political history, classical languages and literature, European art and literature, American art, and American political history.\nThis course requires two (2) online proctored examinations.\n\nLocal students will take exams in the DCE Testing Center (no charge).\nOff-campus students will take exams using an online proctored exam service.

    "description": "Mythology provides a way of thinking about the world that helps provide answers to many fundamental questions that all cultures ask themselves. While these questions may be universal, the answers they provide tell us a lot about the concerns and values of the culture that produced them. This course will examine the stories of gods and legendary heroes that were told in ancient Greece and Rome. The central aims of the course will be to study these myths in their various literary forms, such as epic and drama. We will look at these myths not simply as “ingredients” of ancient culture, but as important vehicles used by the Greeks and Romans to explain themselves to themselves. We will also look at how classical mythology has impacted western art and literature. Reading assignments are taken from a textbook and six Greek tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides.

    "description": "The first three centuries after Jesus’ death saw Christianity grow from a small Jewish sect into a largely gentile religion that spanned the Roman world. But, did you know that the idea of a single united Church has never been a historical reality? From the earliest generations, Christians debated and fought over such issues as the exact nature of Jesus, whether or not they had to be Jewish, and even whether it was the teaching or the death of Jesus that brought salvation. In an age of sectarian dispute, how could you know which group had the “true” message and path to salvation? Since Jesus wrote nothing himself, authority was sought through his apostles and closest associates. And, since they did not have armies, their battles over authority were waged through narratives. This course will examine these battles over authority by analyzing several of the early Christian gospels, both canonical (e.g. Matthew and John) and non-canonical (e.g. Thomas, Mary, and Judas), paying particular attention to the depiction of Jesus and his apostles. Student grades will be based on attendance and participation, several short reflective and analytical papers, a group project, and a take home exam.",

    "description": "Mythical journeys to otherworldy places are common in Mediterranean cultures, and represent important points of intersection between the ancient Near East and Classical worlds.  A fundamental aspect of these mythical journeys is the natural division between the realm of the living and that of the dead.  These mythical journeys served various objectives in their respective cultures, including describing heroic actions of central characters (divine or human), symbolizing the quest for secret knowledge, serving as an explanation of what awaits the faithful beyond death, or endorsing a political or economic system by mirroring it in the afterlife.  The course examines myths of otherworld journeys from the earliest religions up through the Hellenistic period, situating them in historical context and comparing them, asking whether there are common themes in their evolution over time.  Directed readings of mythological texts dealing with otherworldly journeys allow students to gain a better understanding of ways in which past cultures confronted the larger mysteries of life and death.",

Using Wheelock's Latin (Chapters 20-33), students continue to learn the fundamentals of the Latin language (forms, syntax, and vocabulary), while reading excerpts from ancient authors and studying the historical and cultural contexts in which these authors wrote. While the emphasis is on translating from Latin into English, some composition from English into Latin also is required. Grades are based on daily assignments, weekly quizzes, and four exams. Support materials and a free tutoring service are available. An attendance requirement permits seven absences before the final grade is lowered.

    "description": "This course covers the basic elements of the analysis of labor markets. On the supply side of these markets, it addresses issues of occupational choice, the choice between pursuing an education and joining the labor force, and the choice of an optimal retirement age. On the demand side, it looks at optimal reward schemes and procedures for screening job applicants, among other topics. Impediments to the functioning of these markets and possible policy responses are identified. Examples of policy issues in the labor market are: \"Should there be anti-scab rules? Should employers pay for their employees' health insurance? Should government mandate an apprenticeship system? What should be the extent of protection against racial and sexual discrimination in the labor market?\".",

    "description": "\"Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.\" - Oliver Wendall Holmes, Jr., 1904. \"Read my lips. No new taxes.\" - George Bush, 1988. Americans have always held strong opinions about taxes. And well they should. Federal, state, and local taxes now average about 30 percent of Gross National Product. Our objective in this course is to answer several questions about the U. S. tax system: Is it fair? Does it discourage saving? Working? Does it put U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the new \"global\" economy? How can it be improved? Are taxes too high? Answers depend on tax policies in other countries since, in today's highly integrated global economy, the effects of a nation's tax system do not stop at its borders. We first study the basic concepts and theory needed to analyze the effects of taxes and then read and critique several studies of taxation in the U.S. and other countries.",

    "description": "Econometrics is the application of statistics to problems in empirical economics. It provides the tools for testing whether economic theories are consistent with real world observations and for using the theories to make predictions of how economic policy measures or changes in other factors would affect the economy. This course is taught in a computerized classroom where each student sits at a microcomputer. Using real data, students will learn and use econometric methods for testing theories and making predictions. The empirical problems that are investigated vary from year to year. Here are some examples of problems investigated in past years: \"How well can stock prices be predicted? Does speed on the highway kill? Why did ridership on the Iowa City bus system decrease steadily through most of the 1980's? How much is increased automobile fuel economy worth?\".",

We will start with fairy tales, folklores, and then move on to stories, essays and poems. We will evaluate and discuss the craft of fiction, non-fiction and poetry (point of view, setting, plot, character, imagery, etc.), and pay special attention to the prose and verse.\nNo former writing experience is required for this class. This will be a fail-safe trial. We will form a supportive group together to get you started and let you enjoy the fun of creative writing.\nOur class will meet once a week, and there will be no exam.

We will learn by reading closely and by critiquing each other’s work constructively. We’ll discuss how to craft complicated characters, evocative settings, compelling plots, as well as how these things are shaped by point of view. And we will investigate the particular challenges to writing science fiction—like how to get readers to suspend their sense of disbelief, or how to build convincing worlds.

In addition to pragmatic lessons focused on the modes of writing students can expect to encounter in a professional environment, our approach will include readings and creative exercises in fiction and personal narrative, through which students will further develop their attention to the written word and their ability to express themselves distinctively and persuasively.

    "description": "These days, it’s harder than ever to write without the distractions of the outside world. You may be sitting down to write a short story when your phone tells you that somebody liked your Tweet, hear about campus drama on Yik Yak, discover that an online literary journal is accepting contest submissions for five more minutes, and then become intrigued by an article your friend posted on Facebook and fall into a click bait wormhole. These media interventions don’t mean it’s not possible to hole up in a cabin to write a perfect short story anymore, but that the texture of our reality is changing and that our writing can reflect that reality. We’ll discuss how social media platforms, literary journals, self-publishing, Tumblr and other online communities, YouTube, and other innovations have allowed creative people to reach a larger audience and how this has impacted the world of creative writing.\nThis class will run as part laboratory, part salon. The ultimate goal is not for you to walk away feeling like a literary media guru, but for you to improve your creative writing chops and to have a deeper understanding of how the media has changed the face of creative writing. We’ll discuss the political and ethical aspects of new media, read short fiction that pushes the boundaries of form, explore hypertext fiction, watch YouTube shows, analyze Twitter profiles, read online lit journals, and will do much more to develop a deeper understanding of how media affects creative writing today. Class attendance and participation will factor heavily into your grade, as will your work on a group project and a creative project of your own. Exploration and experimentation are always encouraged.",

    "description": "In this class we’ll learn how to write sentences by learning how to read them. We’ll begin by looking at syntax and grammar, moving from simple subject-verb-object sentences to multi-clausal juggernauts. Once we’ve mastered the basics of how sentences are put together, we’ll start reading different authors to develop a taste for sentence style. We’ll study long sentences and short sentences, lyrical sentences and satirical sentences, oratorical sentences and expository sentences, always with an eye for what makes them interesting or beautiful. With weekly writing assignments you’ll craft each of these sentence types yourself, refining your own voice and style. By the end of the semester you’ll have filled a portfolio with dozens of sentences that you can draw from for the final project, an original story or essay that will contain at least one sentence of every type.\n This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "“Virtually every writer I know would rather be a musician.” — Kurt Vonnegut\nHe’s joking, but there’s some truth to it. Music and storytelling have similar aims, and through this course, we will examine the ways in which songs and stories move us. Musical concepts will be applied to writing and vice versa, and through pairings of stories and songs, we will see how they both use aspects of language, rhythm, texture, and tonality to affect us. Later in the semester, we’ll try our hand at our own creative projects, sharing them with each other in a workshop setting. Experience as a musician is not necessary for this course—just an appreciation for, and interest in, music and writing.\nWe will read Flannery O’Connor’s “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” and pair it with Sufjan Stevens’ song of the same name—a take on the story told from the perspective of the villain. We’ll listen to Nick Hornby and Ben Fold’s literary collaboration album, Lonely Avenue, asking ourselves whether novelists make for good lyricists. We’ll read “Sonny’s Blues” by James Baldwin and pair him with Kendrick Lamar, marveling at how Baldwin is able to capture, in words, the ecstatic feeling of a perfect improvisation.\nCoursework will include reading, listening, and writing. We will spend class time responding to readings and listening with creative free writing. Your final portfolio will be comprised of works of fiction or nonfiction composed over the course of the semester. More than anything, this class will be about translating that spark of joy that we all experience in music into the world of writing.\nBelow please find texts likely to be required (available at Prairie Lights Books):\nA Visit from the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan",

The chemical industry employs nearly 800,000 people within the U.S. and every one job in the chemistry industry generates 7.6 jobs elsewhere, totaling almost 6 million jobs for the U.S. economy. The business of chemistry is essential to the economy and health of every industrialized nation and developing countries. In this course we will cover the principles of chemistry and how the basic concepts and reactions of chemistry impact the business world and the global economy.\nThis course is designed for those who need a general education course and have not taken a chemistry course since high school (or may not have taken chemistry in high school!). I will assume a basic working knowledge of mathematics and an ability to use a calculator. I will assume that everyone knows that there is a periodic table and that we are made of atoms, the rest we will explore together. What I expect out of students is willingness and eagerness to learn about something that may be out of their area of expertise, but that will apply to many different parts of their lives. I am constantly amazed at the beauty of chemistry, and I hope you will be too. You will be given homework – it is important to do homework to learn the material – and you will have exams to test your knowledge. You will also have a chance to write a final paper to demonstrate a deep knowledge of a particular area of chemistry.",

The course is divided into units, each of which concludes with a multiple-choice exam. There is also a comprehensive final. As many as three professors share the teaching duties for these lecture content units and an additional instructor is responsible for material in the laboratory. The course comprises three 50-minute lectures (faculty instructors), a 50- minute discussion session (TA), laboratory case studies (80 minutes in alternate weeks; faculty instructor) and laboratory experiments (170 minutes in alternate weeks; TA). The course requires a significant time commitment (an average of 6 hours in-class and 8-10 hours out of class per week). This course is intended for engineering, science, and pre-professional majors or anyone planning to take two years of chemistry.

The course is the first half of a yearlong sequence which covers the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds. It begins with a review of atomic structure and covalent bonding, and continues with a sequence of topics based on the concept of functional groups, and specific groupings of atoms which serve as the site of most organic reactions. The structure, stereochemistry, physical properties, reactivity, and synthesis of different compound classes are discussed, with emphasis on alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatic compounds, alkyl halides, and alcohols. A knowledge of reaction mechanisms is stressed to provide unifying principles. Grades are based on three or four one-hour exams, and a comprehensive final. There are three lectures each week by the professor and a number of discussion sections led by a TA. Because the chemistry of carbon is three-dimensional, students are strongly advised to buy and use a molecular models kit.",

This seems to be an important question; indeed it seems to be the question, but philosophers have taken a number of different positions in attempting to answer it. In the first segment of the course, we will consider the issue of whether or not there is a connection between the value of human pursuits and the existence of God and the afterlife. In the second segment we will address the related issue of whether or not the best life is a life of hedonistic self-interest or a life that is guided by a concern for those around us. In the next segment of the course we will consider the Stoic and Buddhist view that happiness is not a matter of making things go as we please but instead is a matter of adjusting to the way that things happen inevitably and on their own. Then we will discuss what some critics have taken to be obstacles in the way of a meaningful life--for example the internet, technology, modernity, and the I-pod. The semester will conclude with a discussion of the prospect that life is just absurd. Philosophers have offered compelling insights on the different sides of these issues, and we will have a lot of discussion to try to sort it all out. Assignments will include study-question assignments, two exams, and active participation in discussion section.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "Socrates held that the only way to arrive at the truth is by an honest and objective use of critical reasoning. This course covers some of the main methods and principles that can be used to objectively evaluate whether an argument is good or bad. These techniques will be illustrated by considering controversial topics in ethics, science, and religion, among others. We look at how to recognize an argument before evaluating it, and Socrates' distinction between sophistry (persuasive techniques) and philosophy (rational argument). Methods for objectively evaluating deductive and inductive arguments will both be discussed. We also consider the difference between deductive proof and providing evidence for (or against) a given theory such as evolution or creationism.\nStudents who have acquired reasoning skills by learning and practicing these distinctly philosophical methods obtain better scores on professional school entrance exams such as the LSAT, GMAT, MCAT, and GRE. These skills are extremely valuable in almost any course or job that involves creative thinking, writing and analytical work.\nThe course satisfies the General Education requirement in Quantitative and Formal Reasoning. It is also a good way of preparing for other courses in philosophy such as Introduction to Philosophy, Twentieth-Century Philosophy, Analytic Ethics, and of course Introduction to Symbolic logic (which is a requirement for a major in Philosophy).\nCoursework involves doing a relatively small amount of scheduled reading from the textbook, and discussing the homework exercises at the end of each section in the textbook. Online homework exercises provide immediate and customized feedback. Exams are closely modeled on the exercises, most of which are answered in class.\nThis course has no prerequisites.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may contact the course instructor in order to request permission to enroll.",

No prior experience in reading philosophy is required. \nThe problems which perplexed the ancient philosophers include: is it possible to think or speak of what is not? How many kinds of things exist? What are the primary constituents of the things that are? How is it possible for one thing to change into another? What sorts of basic items must we posit as underlying any sort of change? Are we capable of acquiring knowledge about the natural world? If so, what are the objects of such knowledge, and how is it that we have cognitive access to these? Human beings also assure themselves that they are capable of acquiring moral knowledge, or the knowledge of what the best sort of life for a human being is. But is this assurance based on some sort of illusion? If it is, is the illusion remediable? Assuming we are capable of moral knowledge, is the nature of this knowledge the same, or importantly different from, our knowledge of the natural world?",

    "description": "Much of philosophy in the 17th Century is an adjustment of the new Galilean science to theological and other pre-scientific commitments. There were particles and laws of nature, but only in ways allowed by proper conceptions of matter and causation; there was free will and agency, but only in ways allowed by a proper conception of God. The adjustment, of course, went both ways, and in particular, insights in science suggested and then guided revisions of belief in theology. In this course we examine central components of the philosophical systems of Rene Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Nicholas Malebranche, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, and G.W. Leibniz. There will be a lot of discussion of free will and human responsibility in the context of deterministic science.  We will also consider views and arguments surrounding science v. religion, the nature and existence of God, the nature and existence of the physical world, skepticism, the place of minds in a physical universe, the limits of human cognition, and the good life. Course requirements are a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final paper (6-8 pages).",

    "description": "Consider the following scenario:  You are walking alongside some train tracks when you discover that a runaway trolley is headed right for five people tied to the tracks.  As it happens, you can pull a lever to divert the trolley in a different direction, thereby saving the five – but also killing one person who happens to be tied to the side-track.  What ought you to do in this situation?  Most people would say they would pull the lever.  But now consider a variation on this scenario: Suppose instead that you are on the trolley that is headed toward the five people, and the only way you can save them is by pushing a very large person standing beside you over the front of the trolley so that his bulk stops it, killing him but saving the other five.  (Of course, you considered sacrificing yourself, but realized that your slender body would not stop the trolley.)  Now what should you do? Notice that if you push the person, you get the same consequence:  five persons live and one dies.  Or consider a parallel medical case: If a medical team has enough time and resources to save either one person or a group of five others, but not both, it seems they should save the five; but what if they could only save the five by killing the one and using the organs to save the others?  Once again, if they do so then the consequences would be the same: five live and one dies.  But then, why hesitate to kill the one to save the five?\nThe trolley case and other cases like it highlight a central problem in ethical theory.  In evaluating whether an action is right or wrong, should we look only to the consequences of these actions, or is something else relevant?  If only the consequences matter, why do we feel, at least initially, that killing the one to save the five is wrong?  If something else is relevant, what is it, and why does it matter?\nWe make moral judgments on a regular basis in our lives, judgments to the effect that some goal or purpose is good, that some decision or action is right or wrong, or that some person is a good or bad person.  Despite the fact that such judgment are commonly made and acted upon, and have deep and significant consequences, people rarely subject them to much critical reflection.  We rarely ask what exactly we mean by such judgments, or on what basis they ought to be made. What is it for something to be good or bad?  What constitutes a good or valuable life for a human being?  What is it for an action to be right or wrong? Is the rightness of actions determined solely by the value of the consequences of actions?  What role, if any, do agents’ motives or intentions play in determining the rightness or wrongness of actions?  In this course we examine classical and contemporary works that articulate and defend particular answers to such important questions.\nCourse objectives:  To help you \n\nidentify central questions in ethics;\nunderstand and be able to explain the leading answers to such questions;\ndevelop the skills needed to compare and critically evaluate competing answers to these questions;\ndevelop the skills needed to examine the implications such answers have for some controversial moral problems;\nimprove your ability to write clear argumentative essays.\n\n Readings:  ICON site.If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may contact the course instructor in order to request permission to enroll.",

    "description": "Topics: The notion of human rights is often used both in the media and by scholars, but often without clarity regarding what human rights are. We will start this class by asking :what are human rights? What sorts of commitments does one make when they assert that X is a human right? What would it mean to say that some rights are not human rights? This course will attempt to provide a deeper philosophical and legal understanding of the concept of human rights. After asking conceptual questions about human rights the second half of the course will focus (through examining contemporary philosophical texts and using some legal instruments) on particular human rights: women's rights, children's rights, social and economic rights, etc. We'll ask whether it makes sense to call certain rights women’s rights (and what’s the value of doing so). We'll ask whether social and economic rights are truly human rights and what are the consequences of saying so. We'll also spend some time thinking about enforcement mechanisms for human rights.\nBEITZ, CHARLES R.

We will consider these and other questions in this survey of central issues in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. These include what makes something art, the justification of aesthetic judgments, how to classify new art forms, the various sorts of values we find in art, and the relations between art and morality, and art and politics. Along the way we will also learn about art through numerous examples by many different artists, build our own self-curated art galleries, and engage in art criticism.  All materials will be available online.",

These are the questions we shall ask as we survey the teachings of the Buddha as they are represented in the first eight chapters of Śāntideva’s Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life (G). In these chapters it is explained how to practice the perfections of generosity, ethical discipline, patience, joyful effort, and meditation. In the ninth chapter the practice of the perfection of wisdom is explained, but in place of a study of this perfection we shall study passages from the instructor’s translation of the sixth chapter of Candrakīrti’s Commentary on the Middle Way (C). In support of our study of the first eight chapters we shall read a Buddhist commentary on the Guide, entitled Meaningful to Behold (MB), by Geshe Gyatso. We shall also study Dale Wright’s contemporary interpretation of the practice of these six perfections, entitled The Six Perfections: Buddhism and the Cultivation of Character.  G and MB will be available at the University Bookstore and C on ICON.",

    "description": "Free Will – What is it and do we have it?\nWe all assume that we have free will and that at every point we can choose a course of action from a range of possibilities. At the same time, we also acknowledge that we are a part of a physical universe in which every event has a cause. We may not know or be aware of causes of certain events, but we have good reasons to assume that such causes are out there. Similarly, we are aware that our psychological characteristics, together with our beliefs and desires, cause us to act in certain ways. We may not know or be aware of all of the causal factors, but we have good reasons to assume that they shape who we are and how we act. But if this is all so, how can we have freedom of the will? Is freedom of the will compatible with the causal picture just sketched? How should we define freedom of the will and is this concept central to who we are as persons? \nThrough lively discussion, presentations, and writing, we will explore these and a number of other questions that pertain to philosophical debate about free will. \nTextbook: All readings will be available on ICON.",

    "description": "This course is devoted to a close examination of Aristotle’s moral theory as that is articulated in his Nicomachean Ethics, one of the most influential treatises in the history of ethics. We will pay particular attention to Aristotle’s theory of moral knowledge and his response to questions such as the following: what is the nature of moral knowledge and how is it acquired? Is objective moral knowledge even possible? How should we respond to the moral skeptic who argues that it is not? A second major focus will be on Aristotle’s virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is concerned with the kind of person you are---just, courageous, moderate with respect to bodily appetites, truthful, generous, friendly----and explains the rightness of right action in terms of such virtuous states of the person. In Aristotle’s view, a virtue is a disposition of the person to act in various ways as opposed to others; such dispositions in the completely virtuous person are crucially integrated into a capacity for both practical reasoning and appropriate emotional response. We will explore how Aristotle thinks virtue is related to human flourishing (or eudaimonia, sometimes translated as ‘happiness’) and right action, and the manner in which virtue involves aspiring to an ideal. Other major topics will include Aristotle’s account of the various virtues of character; his account of practical intelligence, moral deliberation, voluntary action, choice, and weakness of will; his theory of friendship; his rejection of hedonism and his metaphysically complex theory of the nature of pleasure. Along the way we will also read shorter selections from the Platonic corpus on the nature of moral knowledge, pleasure, and moral psychology, especially where Aristotle is responding to and critiquing the views of his predecessor and teacher Plato. This course is intended for advanced philosophy majors (of sophomore standing or higher) and graduate students.",

    "description": "What is LOGIC and what is MIND that it may know it?\nThis seminar investigates the question of the nature of logic and the question of what philosophy of mind can offer the best explanation of our access to logic. Different conceptions of logic and mind will be discussed. It will be found that the two notions always go hand in hand.  The course will discuss the problem of how (and whether) minds that know logic can evolve by natural selection and the problem of how (and whether) mathematical/logical truths can be in the world.  We will discuss the infamous Meinongian problem of how we think about what is not, the role of impredicative concept formation in logic and mind, the question of the informativity of logic, the nature of reason (Lewis Carroll’s “What Achilles said to the Tortoise”), rival logics (modal, intuitionistic, relevant), recursion, and whether Gődel’s famous results have any bearing on the nature of mind.",

    "description": "In today's world, possibly more than ever, questions regarding civil disobedience are becoming increasingly interesting. These questions include practical concerns, like: when and how ought one to engage in civil disobedience so as to achieve the desired aim, as well as, what laws can one or should one violate when engaging in civil disobedience. Careful answers to such questions are obviously underpinned by more theoretical normative and conceptual analyses. In this class, we will start by asking conceptual questions like: what exactly is civil disobedience and how is the concept of civil disobedience related to political obligation and state authority. We will then turn to normative questions, including: is civil disobedience ever permitted and if so under what conditions is it permitted? We will also ask whether civil disobedience is ever obligatory. We will read both traditional philosophical literature on civil disobedience, political obligation and legitimate political authority as well as look at specific cases. We will also engage with some non-western philosophical literature on civil disobedience.",

    "description": "This course offers students a broad overview of the role nonprofit organizations play in building and enhancing local communities. Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations. Students will be graded on discussion forums, short writing assignments, and a final strategic plan.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "This course will introduce first-year students enrolled in any major at the University of Iowa to the financial marketplace. By taking up discrete articles from the Wall Street Journal, the Economist, and the Financial Times, the students will understand the basics of financial and economic policy, investments, and corporate finance. The students will work in groups of two and present their understanding and criticism of the assigned articles. This will be accompanied by the instructor’s own views. The students will benefit in the following ways by taking this course. First, they will understand isolated features of the financial marketplace and the economy. Second, they will understand what a finance major is all about and whether it is right for them. Third, they will understand a few basics of personal investments that will help them in life even if they do not take another finance course. The students will be graded based on their class presentations and contributions. The students will be required to subscribe to the Wall Street Journal for the duration of this course. (However, they will not be required to subscribe to the Economist or the Financial Times for which many articles are available free of charge on the internet.) An important course requirement will be the willingness to work with another student and talk about diverse financial topics without fear of criticism.",

Many of the traditional methods for financial professionals to complete work assignments have changed dramatically requiring skills that range from data acquisition to data analysis and synthesis. The purpose of this class is to provide exposure and practice basic tools that are needed to become proficient with a number of important finance technologies. The goal is to provide a solid grounding in the core principles of finance so that students can be successful in their careers and in managing their personal finances. To reinforce these key ideas in our electives, specially crafted applications and cases are used to strengthen understanding of critical concepts. These cases allow students to see how core concepts are applied to actual problems.

    "description": "The banking industry has undergone massive transformation due to deregulation and competition from non-banks in the last decade. In the near future, the shape and scope of commercial banks will look nothing like its past. For example, with the slow demise of Glass-Steagall Act (1933), the separation between commercial and investment banks has become blurred. Recently, several banks have received approval to underwrite debt and equity offerings. This course examines recent trends in regulation and product innovation by commercial banks. The objective is to equip students with principles and tools which allow them to tackle realistic risk management problems associated with financial institutions. Topics include bank organization and regulation structure of the U.S. banking industry; role of bank regulation from a historical perspective; competition from non-banks; evolution of commercial banking in the U.S.; Community Reinvestment Act and bank mergers; role of CRA in lending practices by banks; the role of CRA in bank mergers; role of investment banks in mergers and acquisitions; organization of commercial banks for operations--importance of size markets; asset and liability management; GAP analysis: measuring changes in net interest income; duration GAP: managing changes in market value of equity; use of futures and swaps to hedge interest rate exposure; characteristics of financial futures: speculation versus hedging; interest rate swaps as a hedging tool; capital risk management and credit policy; risk-based capital standards; how much capital is adequate; global banking issues, foreign banking activities in the U.S.; U.S. versus Japanese/German financial system.",

Beginning with the analysis of film narrative, lectures will turn to aspects of form and style: mise-en- scène, cinematography, editing, and sound. The second half of the semester will consider special topics of film analysis such as ideology, genre, and the influences of documentary and the avant-garde on narrative film. Two short writing assignments will evaluate students' comprehension and analytical skills. A mid-term exam and a final exam will test for knowledge of film vocabulary.",

We will then study procedures for composing traditional written criticism and begin to write our own works. Production-oriented students or those wishing to learn editing skills will have the opportunity to create works of videographic criticism (video essays).\nFor screenings, we will focus on cinema of the past decade so that students will be able to comment on and intervene in dialogues in contemporary criticism. Screenings may include films by the Coen Brothers, Jean-Luc Godard, Lynn Shelton, Christopher Nolan, Ryan Coogler, Alejandro González Iñárritu, the Dardenne Brothers, and Quentin Tarantino.\nCourse requirements include attendance and participation, mandatory weekly screenings, completion of all course readings, short writing assignments, and two longer pieces of criticism that we will workshop as a class in the final weeks.",

    "description": "The recording and conduct of warfare has drastically changed in an age of digital photography and drone warfare. How have different wars presented a challenge to diverse modes of documenting, from literature, poetry, and photography, to film, video games, and digital media in general?  What are the different ways in which artists and governments, soldiers and civilians have used different media to try to capture aspects of wars (violence and trauma; heroism and cowardice; collective versus personal memory)? This course takes the opportunity of the centennial of America’s entry into World War One to investigate the specific challenges (representational, ideological, ethical, aesthetic, technological) different wars have posed to our recording practices. We will study key historical and theoretical texts dealing with war and representation, alongside key examples of photography (from the work of Mathew Brady and Robert Capa to amateur photographer-soldiers), literature (Samuel Hynes’ pilot memoir), and film, including Hollywood blockbusters (Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down), traditional, televisual, and experimental documentary (Night and Fog, Burns’ Civil War, Far from Vietnam, the compilation works of Gianikian and Lucchi), government propaganda (Triumph of the Will), animation (Waltz with Bashir), comedy (Chaplin’s Shoulder Arms) and video games (Call of Duty and Battlefield 1).  Requirements include reading of all set readings, active participation, attendance at all screenings and classes, 3 mini-exams, one talk, and two essays.",

    "description": "Beginning with the consolidation of New Hollywood in the 1970s, and intensifying with the dominance of digital imaging technologies since the 1990s, special effects became a core component of Hollywood film production. Crucial to a range of genres, such as science fiction, action, horror, and even comedy, special effects have also been central to the films of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, David Fincher, and Christopher Nolan. This course will trace the history of special effects from cultural, economic, technical, and aesthetic perspectives. We will address questions like: how do we distinguish “special effects” from other technological products, such as widescreen, sound, color, 3D, and high frame rate? What separates these effects from other kinds of spectacles, like chase scenes, musical numbers, and stunts, as well as production design, sets, and makeup? And what is the relationship between “practical” and digital effects? As the line dividing recorded reality from computer generated animation narrows, a reconsideration of special effects helps raise foundational questions about the status of popular cinema in the 21st century.\nFilms may include: A Trip to the Moon (1902), Metropolis (1927), King Kong (1933), The War of the Worlds (1953), Godzilla (1954), Mary Poppins (1964), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Alien (1979), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), The Fly (1986), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Jurassic Park (1993), The Matrix (1999), King Kong (2005), Zodiac (2008), Avatar (2009), and Life of Pi (2012).\nGrades will be based on a midterm and final paper, participation, a presentation, and a few quizzes.",

    "description": "This course will examine intersections of race, gender, and sexuality as represented in American and transnational film and television. Beginning with the end of the classical Hollywood era, we will explore films that are regarded as indicating and/or facilitating key paradigm shifts in the evolution of diversity and representation in American cinema, including films such as Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, She’s Gotta Have It, Tongues Untied, and Paris Is Burning.  We will also explore more recent examples of radical representation in films such as Get Out, Moonlight, Tangerine, and Precious.  Students will be asked to consider African-American, Asian- American, and Chicana/o and Latina/o representations as they intersect with representations of – and issues related to – women and LGBTQ+ identities in popular, independent, and experimental media arts.  Students will also be asked to consider the role of intersecting racisms and sexisms in both mainstream and independent cinema, the role of feminism, activism, and/or resistance in film and television (and music videos), the role of social, political, and economic ideologies such as neoliberalism in American and transnational cinemas, and the role of contemporary queer culture along with new technologies in the evolution of radical filmmaking.\nFilms screened will include Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), Get Out (2017), She’s Gotta Have It (1986), Eat a Bowl of Tea (1989), Tongues Untied (1989), Paris Is Burning (1990), Irma Vep (1996), Moolaadé (2004), Diary of a Mad Black Woman (2005), Precious (2009), Pariah (2011), Mosquita y Mari (2012), Moonlight (2016), Portrait of Jason (1967), and Tangerine (2015), as well as in-class screenings of clips from films including The Celluloid Closet (1995), Black Girl (1966), Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley (2013), Lip (1999), Lemonade (2016), and television shows including All-American Girl (1994), Fresh Off the Boat (2015-present), RuPaul’s Drag Race (2009-present), Ugly Betty (2006-2010), Jane the Virgin (2014-present), and Orange is the New Black (2013-present). \nStudents are required to attend the class sessions and a film screening each week.  Course work includes a midterm, two papers (a shorter analysis paper and a longer research paper), a presentation, and submitting weekly discussion questions.  Active participation in class and engagement with course materials is required.  All reading materials will be made available online.  \nRequired Texts: \nAll readings for this course are posted on the course website.  Films for this course will be screened each Monday, 10:30am-1:00pm, in E146 AJB.  Films are also on reserve at the Main Library for additional viewings.  They can be checked-out, but screened only at the library.  Some films are also available for streaming on the course website.",

    "description": "From the big screen to the miniature model set, panoramic IMAX mountain ranges to hidden worlds under blades of grass, cinema has served as a prominent site for explorations of scale. Emerging gaming technologies both draw on cinematic traditions and amplify our embodied experience of scale, heightening both our ability to shrink down and to loom large over the sets and figures that visual narratives comprise. In the near future, emerging VR technology will significantly shift the existing relations of scale among entertainment media and everyday space within the home.\nThis graduate seminar engages with theories of scale in both cinema and wider visual culture. We will read scholarship from a range of disciplines (including literary criticism, film theory, psychopathology, critical videogame studies, and socio-anthropology) and therefore approach questions about scale from multiple vantage points. The syllabus’s core concepts are built around works by Susan Stewart, Mary Ann Doane, Gaston Bachelard, Roland Barthes, and Walter Benjamin. We will read core theoretical works explicitly about cinema and in relation to scale, both as spatial phenomena (e.g., texts about the close-up by Epstein, Aragon, Eisenstein) and in closely related temporal categories (e.g., works on reverie and duration in cinema by Mulvey, Bazin, Deleuze). And we will also apply to the cinema other objects and concepts that engage with scale in different contexts—e.g., art objects like Cornell Boxes (Falcetta, Leppanen-Guerra), or toys and play (Brougère) and childhood (Caillois).\nIn this seminar, we will encounter a range of cinematic texts, including documentaries (e.g., Powers of Ten, 1977), CGI-heavy fiction films (e.g., Cloverfield, 2008), animation (e.g., the Secret World of Arietty, 2010; Ponyo, 2008; Alice in Wonderland, 1951), and VR games and cinema (e.g., Golem, forthcoming). Students should expect a rigorous reading schedule, culminating in the design of an original seminar paper that reflects their research interests.",

    "description": "Can effective film criticism and film theory take the form of cinema itself? Is cinema, as Jean-Luc Godard suggests, “a form that thinks”?  This seminar will consider the critical examination of cinema through various forms of audio-visual media.  After surveying the historical models and traditions of the compilation film (Esfir Shub), found footage film (Joseph Cornell, Bruce Conner), and the essay film (Chris Marker, Agnes Varda), we will move towards a focus on the status and functions of the contemporary video essay (or videographic criticism).  After building upon aesthetic and theoretical underpinnings in practices of collage and montage, we will consider influential examples of film criticism, history, and theory in the form of cinema, ranging from somewhat conventional documentaries such as A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies (1995), Mark Cousins’ The Story of Film: An Odyssey (2011), and Thom Andersen’s Los Angeles Plays Itself (2003), to more unconventional work, such as Marlon Riggs’ Ethnic Notions (1987), Valerie Soe’s Picturing Oriental Girls (1992), Mark Rappaport’s Rock Hudson’s Home Movies (1992) and Sophie Fiennes’ The Pervert’s Guide to Cinema (2006).  A significant portion of the course will center on viewing and discussing Jean-Luc Godard’s Histoire(s) du cinéma (1988-1998) and critical work on it.  The final portion of the seminar will focus on the contemporary video essay, represented by a wide range of examples, including work by Kevin B. Lee, Tony Zhou, kogonada, Adrian Martin and Cristina Álvarez López, Catherine Grant, Jen Proctor, and Allison de Fren, among others. Students will be given the option of writing about or creating video essays (or some combination of both) as their primary work for the course.  Appropriate and wide-ranging readings (from the early 20th-century avant-garde to online journals of videographic criticism) will also be assigned.",

The course builds on computational (programming) and bioscience (genetics/genomics) topics. It seeks to provide broad exposure to common tools, and provide enough experience in applying them to contemporary problem settings to serve as a gateway to electives in Bioinformatics. For students who already have a software and computing background (have taken at least ENGR:1300 and ENGR:2730 or equivalent), this course provides a solid bio-context for using those previously developed skills. Students who do not have any previous computing experience should not take this course. Topics include: Tools at the developer level: UNIX, BioPerl, BLAST/BLAT, R, web-based tools, Apache, PHP, etc. Common Data Models: NCBI/EMBL, sequence, expression, proteomics, systems biology/pathways, clinical information, genotyping, structural chemistry (pdb), etc. Data Analysis and Annotation: e.g., transcription and expression, genomics, proteomics, clustering, basic linkage, comparative genomics, statistical genetics. Common access and APIs to data repositories and results: Interface design, submission protocols, data exchange formats, web services, etc. LIMS: Laboratory Information Management Systems: Raw experimental data, protocol management, experiment design specifications.",

We use the term “grammar” to mean the system of structural rules which describes how words combine with each other to form sentences. In this sense, native speakers of English already have an instinctive knowledge of its grammar. However, the study of language enables us to externalize and formalize this instinctive knowledge and thus can help us to communicate more effectively. Quite simply, if we know how English works, then we can make better use of it. In short, the study of grammar enables us to go beyond our instinctive, native-speaker knowledge, and to use English in an intelligent, informed way.\nEvaluation will consist of regular homework assignments, two in-class exams, and a cumulative final exam.\n \n \nThis course is a Core Course for the Undergraduate Certificate in Writing.",

    "description": "Most writers will agree that in order to be successful they need four basic things: time to create, a group of engaged readers/editors, a venue to share their work, and coffee. While an in-class espresso machine can’t be guaranteed, in this Writing Commons course you will increase your skills as a writer, editor, and community member by considering what it takes to actually live as a writer. Readings will include inspiring examples of excellent long-form essays, creative texts, and hybrid literature, as well as interviews with famous authors on the art of writing. (After all, who better to teach you about the writer’s life than the writers themselves?) Through three creatively inspired unit essay assignments (personal narrative, profile, and a hybrid creative project that will ask you to bend and blend genres), you will participate in workshops that will help generate new and inventive writing and provide the opportunity to share work with an intelligent group of like-minded peers. In addition to absorbing large-scale concepts of craft (e.g. dialogue, description, figurative language), you will learn helpful tips and tricks to improve your writing style (e.g. how to thwart punctuation errors, how to improve transitions between paragraphs). You will also gain real world experience with general publishing guidelines by actually submitting your essays to local and national publications. The goal of this class, however, is not to get published. Rather—through close analysis of our individual writing processes, as well as doing the editorial footwork needed to meet the guidelines of established journals and newspapers —you will explore the communities of writing present around you, taking time to realize that to live as a writer you must allow yourself to bring your voice into the larger literary conversation. Required work: weekly reading/writing assignments, three unit essays, a public class reading, and the creation of a final chapbook or author website.\nIndividual sections of this course have varying topics. Please see section description for specific information about each section.",

    "description": "Writing can be lonely work—it’s easy to call to mind the image of a solitary writer bent over a notebook or keyboard. But writing is also a way of entering into communities—as participants, observers, cultural critics—and joining in a conversation larger than ourselves. For the purposes of this class, we’ll consider our membership in two distinct but overlapping communities: the local communities in which we each live and work; and the community of the classroom, where we’ll share thoughts and ideas, and strive to nurture each other as writers.\nThis semester we’ll be writing things small and large, planned and spontaneous, raw and revised. In three units, we’ll move from personal reflections to investigations of our surroundings, with plenty of room for exploration and perspective shifting in between. We’ll also read widely, in order to expand our understanding of the literary landscape and to learn by example. As readers, we'll hone our skills at investigating and then articulating what we think a piece of writing is trying to accomplish, what strategies the author has employed toward that end, and whether or not the attempt is successful.\nAttempt is a concept we'll keep in mind throughout the semester, as essai—the root of the word essay—means to try or to attempt. Accordingly, we'll be taking risks in this class. We will write some essays that work very well and some essays that don't work at all. In order to learn from our various successes and failures, we will keep our eyes, ears, and hearts open to the constructive criticism of our peers, and when it is our turn to critique the work of others, we will strive to offer commentary and advice that is lucid, respectful and beneficial to the author.\nThroughout the semester, students will participate in small and large group workshops to help generate new and inventive writing, share/revise work, and learn general publishing guidelines by submitting polished pieces to local and national magazines. The goal of this class is not to get published, but to develop confidence and strategies for moving forward as writers, readers, and community members.\nCourse Goals\nBy the end of the course, you will have a final portfolio of original work that showcases your writing across a variety of subjects and modes. You will also have a number of works-in-progress and mini essays that you can expand and revise in the future. You will have become a more critical reader—of your own work and that of others—and you will have honed your skills as an insightful, incisive critic.\nNuts and Bolts, or, How The Course Works\nThis class is divided into three units. Unit One asks you to connect an experience of personal significance to a larger cultural or social issue. Unit Two asks you to venture outside of yourself and into your local community to investigate a venue, trend, or tradition. Unit Three asks you to consider the world through the perspective of another person by means of an interview/profile. For each unit you will write a mini essay (500–750 words) and a larger essay (1200–2000 words).\n This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.  Current UI students should register directly on MyUI.  Students who are not admitted to the UI click here to proceed. Contact 319-335-2575 or dce-registration@uiowa.edu for assistance.",

    "description": "The best writers are also excellent observers. They notice the color of a neighbor’s socks, the flicker of disgust on the face of a dinner guest, the weary note in a cashier’s greeting.Through this course, you will develop the observational skills writers need to succeed in a wide range of professional and creative contexts. An excellent observer is ready to compose an accurate, vibrant description of a sunset or a nose or a Jack Russell terrier. But such an observer is also prepared to report the important details of a chance meeting with a prospective client, to record a patient’s subtle but critical symptom, to summarize the method and findings of an experiment, or to catch the error in a table of financial data.Over five weeks, students will complete exercises, go on explorations, and respond to prompts designed to attune their senses. They will keep detailed observation journals, which each will turn into a final project—a story, an essay, a group of poems, or some other project designed in consultation with the instructor, that demonstrates an improved ability to write clearly, accurately, and compellingly about the observed world.Elizabeth Weiss earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she was a Truman Capote Fellow. Her nonfiction has been featured on The New Yorker website and she is currently at work on her first novel.",

Is that modifier dangling? What's a comma splice? Did I use the right pronoun? What IS a pronoun? But don't panic. Take this class instead! In just five weeks, we will tackle some of the most common grammar mistakes in the English language. We'll strive not just for rote memorization of rules, but a deeper understanding of the underlying structures of the language--the reason the rules make sense. At the end of five weeks, you will be a grammar whiz, ready to write with confidence.",

    "description": "Whether you’re headed for the workforce, graduate school, or another year or two of college, a solid understanding of style is necessary in order to communicate effectively across disciplines, industries, media, and fields of expertise. Research papers, lab reports, news articles, and cover letters all operate according to different rules and guidelines, and in this class we will explore the uses of style manuals, whose influence none of us can escape. While the definition of “style” is broad, in our six weeks together we will look at the purpose of style and explore the specifics needed to write successfully in the humanities, sciences, and creative literature. We will learn when to use a footnote, and when an end note; what level of detail is appropriate in descriptions of scientific test subjects; and finally settle the debate over the Oxford comma in an attempt to make style a graspable tool for the improvement of our writing, rather than a bewildering array of obstacles to overcome. Assignments include weekly writing exercises and a final project in which students apply their new knowledge of style to revise a paper provided by the instructor.",

Do you put off the writing till the last minute and stay up all night trying to think up things to fill the pages? Do you lose your momentum and stall? Do your thoughts wander? If so, this course is for you. The key to writing a good paper or essay is writing a clear, focused thesis statement—a summary of your main point—and making that point with clear, well-structured paragraphs. In just five fast-paced sessions, you’ll learn these two essential skills, which will help you in all types of writing, in and out of college. In the second half of the course we’ll focus on verb usage. You'll learn how to properly execute verb tenses (something beginning writers often have trouble with) and how to choose verbs that give your writing vividness and power. We’ll touch on nouns and adjectives too, since every word counts. By the end of this course, you’ll be a more skilled, confident writer, and the word “paper” won’t scare you like it used to.",

We’ll learn how to wield them unencumbered of the syntax of “is” and “is like.” We’ll consider how a single analogy functioning as the pointy end of the well-turned phrase can just as readily function as the entire architecture for an ambitious work of art. Finally, we’ll apply what we’ve learned in a five-page story or essay based an analogy of your choosing.",

    "description": "This course examines writing strategies (word choice, in particular) within the context of literary analysis. We will study the origins of English words and especially the Latin components that make up the majority of English words—sixty percent of all words and ninety percent of those over two syllables. We also will look closely at three tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, tracing adaptations of Midas, Pyramus and Thisbe, and Pygmalion from antiquity to the present day in poetry, drama, art, and film.\nClass will be a combination of lecture, discussion, video clips, writing exercises, and word games. Some of the writing assignments will be creative, some will be more traditional, but all will be related to what we have just read or viewed. In order to focus on writing at the word and sentence level, the emphasis will be on shorter writing efforts as opposed to long papers. Grades will be based on writing assignments, quizzes, and three exams.\nTranslations of Ovid, Stanley Lombardo’s in particular, will serve as a point of departure. Other readings/viewings will include the works of canonical authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Shaw, as well as those of present-day poets, playwrights, and filmmakers. We also will examine how the English language has changed over time and how an author’s background (era, culture, race, gender, etc.) may have influenced different adaptations of the same story.\nSatisfies one of the requirements for the Undergraduate Certificate in Writing.",

    "description": "You’ve written it—now how do you publish it? This course will investigate the world of publishing, focusing specifically on literary journals, small presses, and our relationship to these outlets as readers, writers, and eventual publishers ourselves. We’ll examine a diverse selection of recently published work, from magazines like Oxford American to The Diagram to The Paris Review, and we’ll talk to the editors who facilitated that work’s exposure, asking them what makes an attractive submission, what their editorial process looks like, how they survive financially, and more. In addition to learning the field’s history and trajectory, we will discuss—and argue, constructively—about the role of publishing today, while confronting the dilemma of what to publish, how to acquire it, and how to get it in the hands of an audience. Most of all, we will strive to become better advocates for our own essays, short stories, and poems, leaving the course able to sharply and smartly articulate our artistic sensibilities to potential readers and editors. This course will include hands-on editorial exercises involving pitching, soliciting, and managing a publication, and will conclude with the production of a literary journal composed of student work.\nInstructor: Micah Fields is from Houston, Texas. He has written and published work about Pizza Hut, collage art, hurricanes, and the war in Afghanistan. He is an MFA candidate in the Nonfiction Writing Program, and he’s currently working on a large project about Houston and the Texas coast.",

    "description": "Previous linguistic experience is not necessary.This course is a Core Course for the Writing Certificate.We look at the history of English from two perspectives: external history and internal history. External history deals with non-linguistic events that played a role in the shaping of the English language. Internal history deals with the changes in the grammar (pronunciation, word classes, sentence structure, and vocabulary).You can learn much history through language. For example, the phrase Johnson County Sheriff is loaded with history. Johnson bears testimony to a Danish occupation of England in the 9th century. County, a French word meaning ‘territory ruled by a count or viscount’, goes back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Sheriff is a truly English word, or rather words, because it comes from shire reeve, a royal administrator of a shire, under Alfred the Great in the 9th century. Shires were replaced by counties by the Normans, but the word still survives in names, for example, (New) Hampshire.We also look at texts and analyze them. You will learn how to read Old English sentences, recite Chaucer in Middle English and read Shakespeare with a 17th century accent. You will discover the reasons why English spelling is irrationally hard; for example, you will understand why the spelling Haus in German makes sense while the spelling house in English does not make sense.Requirements: short homework assignments, two midterm exams and a final exam.Required reading: course pack materials prepared by the instructor.Optional readings: papers on ICON and C. M. Millward (1996), A Biography of the English Language. Boston: Thomson.",

    "description": "“Writing is a struggle against silence.”- Carlos Fuentes \nLanguage equalizes. A strong sense of words, and how to use them well, can transform a student into a self-advocate, a middling job candidate into an outstanding one, a disenfranchised community into a place where dreaming can thrive. \nWriting With Purpose offers students the opportunity to transform language into action as community builders, instructors, mentors, and advocates for various cross-sections of Iowa City’s youth. Through a combination of guided study and hands-on service work, students will create lesson plans, direct activities, and help produce a group publication for a group of young writers at a local school or community center.\nThe course offers three semester hours of credit, broken down as follows. For one hour per week, students will meet in small groups at their chosen community sites to facilitate workshops, lessons, and activities for the youth they’ve elected to serve. The remaining two hours will be spent in class, reflecting on the service experience through group workshops, creative and critical writing, and engagement with theory-driven, pedagogical, and literary texts.\nDrawing on the work of poets, writers, educators, and education activists (including but not limited to Richard Hugo, Kenneth Koch, Georgia Popoff, and Kevin Kumashiro), the course will seek to answer the following questions: How can language serve to empower an individual or community? What is the connection between literacy and social justice? What does it mean to become a community builder, and how can a student most effectively and thoughtfully connect with youth of diverse backgrounds? Special emphasis will be placed on real-world engagement, collaborative learning and leading, sharpening social awareness, and honing practical writing/communication skills. Students will need to undergo a routine background check before working with children.\nRequired texts (available at Prairie Lights Books):\nOur Difficult Sunlight: A Guide to Poetry, Literacy, & Social Justice in the Classroom & Community, Georgia A.

    "description": "The crafted verbal texture of prose style will guide discussion as both a topic and a goal. This is a course in reading for writing. With illustrations drawn from fiction and nonfiction alike, you will be studying master sentences from great writers in order to master sentences of your own, concentrating on diction and syntax, words and their wording, in a mix of intensive reading and applied writing. Like the word itself slipping from adjective to predicate, modifier to subordinate verb, in that last sentence (lesson # 1 right there), how can the very idea of “mastery” shift over from an attribute recognized to a force activated in your own prose? Here is a course in literature as rhetorical example rather than as interpretive challenge. We will be thinking not so much about the style of geniuses as about the genius of style—and how to plug into its energies, not just by aspiration but by practiced strategies of sentence building from week to week.",

In this course, students will be guided by a series of prompts, readings, and targeted assignments that will lead to a shared final goal: an online portfolio of writing that highlights the work created (and the skills gained) while pursuing the Certificate in Writing.\nThough specific content will be unique to each student's individual project, every enrolled member of this course will be required to: draft a capstone 「roadmap」 proposal, substantially revise one portfolio piece to underscore improved writing skills, draft one entirely new piece of writing that connects to the larger themes of the portfolio, create a web-based hosting platform for the capstone project, complete a 「Capstone Introduction」 reflection that prepares readers to engage with the portfolio, and submit a link to the final project by the last day of classes.\nIn addition to these requirements, throughout the term students will be asked to read and respond to published pieces, participate in peer-review sessions, and generate multiple reflections as they progress with their project. Students can expect to get feedback from their instructor on revisions and drafts, and the instructor will also be available for on-campus and online office hours.\nThis is an exciting and rewarding class, but it's important to remind students that the value of their experience (and their grade) will depend greatly on their own commitment to meet deadlines and participate to their fullest extent.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "In this class we’ll learn how to write sentences by learning how to read them. We’ll begin by looking at syntax and grammar, moving from simple subject-verb-object sentences to multi-clausal juggernauts. Once we’ve mastered the basics of how sentences are put together, we’ll start reading different authors to develop a taste for sentence style. We’ll study long sentences and short sentences, lyrical sentences and satirical sentences, oratorical sentences and expository sentences, always with an eye for what makes them interesting or beautiful. With weekly writing assignments you’ll craft each of these sentence types yourself, refining your own voice and style. By the end of the semester you’ll have filled a portfolio with dozens of sentences that you can draw from for the final project, an original story or essay that will contain at least one sentence of every type.\n This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

The first few classes will be picks by me to get the idea going and then we’ll start sharing picks. The assignments will be listening rather than reading. You will legitimately be able to do your homework through your headphones, at the gym or just walking around. We listen to music a lot. We listen in the car, while we eat, while we’re falling asleep. It’s all around all the time and it gives us a chance to stretch our minds and feel creative. Building creative muscles is a marketable job skill. A creative thinker is a valuable employee. Everyone is creative, and there’s no easier or more enjoyable way to get into the practice of thinking creatively than to stop once in a while to listen hard to the words that go with the soundtrack of your life. Here’s a couple of tunes that will probably figure on the first play list: “I’ll Be Your Mirror” (by The Velvet Underground), “Will the Circle Be Unbroken?” (a version by June Carter Cash); “Satisfaction” (by The Rolling Stones).",

    "description": "The main Camino de Santiago, or Way of St. James, is a 500-mile foot path that begins in the Pyrenees, extends across northern Spain, and ends in Santiago de Compostela. This fabled trail began as a medieval pilgrimage route and now attracts more than 200,000 walkers each year from around the world. The modern Camino is a complex experience that combines sport and fitness, travel, geography, food, art, language and cross-cultural communication, at the pace of life lived one step at a time.  Professor Denise Filios, a specialist in medieval Spanish culture, has walked the Camino three times along various routes. She draws upon her experiences to lead you on an imaginary Camino adventure.\nThis course will begin with an overview of the modern Camino as represented in Emilio Estevez´s film \"The Way\" (2010). We will prepare a packing list, schedule and a budget, to make the imaginary trip more real. We will create a collaborative digital map of the Camino Francés and read blogs written by Camino walkers.  By the end of the course, each student will have selected a town or city along the route to investigate and document on the collaborative map, including typical dishes and sites to visit, and written a journal/blog about an imaginary week spent walking the Camino.\nThe final grade will be based on attendance and participation (30%), homework and preparation for class (15%), journal/blog (25%), research/documentation of Camino town (30%).",

One is the language barrier. Successful communication with any patient, requires much more than being able to converse in a shared language. You will also face cultural differences that could significantly impact communication. This course will help you develop strategies to recognize these differences and use them to improve your patients’ and clients’ care.\nThis section uses the communicative approach (conversational and pragmatic) and serves students pursing a career as counselors, administrators, doctors, nurses, social workers, among others. If you are from a field other than health care and are interested in the course, contact the instructor, Ivan Parra.\nYou will take three (3) chapter tests and ONE (1) oral exam during the semester.

Goals are to develop writing skills, to provide contexts for oral communication practice in small group work and situational activities, and to develop the skill to read critically in Spanish. The class is conducted in Spanish and alternates between small group work and activities done by the class as a whole. Grading is based on writing and revising compositions, other shorter writing assignments, and class participation. Other factors that may enter into the grade are oral presentations and short quizzes on the assigned readings. This 4 s.h. course meets 3 hours in the classroom (face to face) weekly; and additional 1 hour per week is devoted to doing on-line activities (assignments on the Vista supersite, blogging, on-line peer review, chatting, or other writing activities using social media) or other activities outside of class, such as timed writing assignments.  Students should plan to devote approximately 12 hours a week to this course. The textbook for this section is Taller de Escritores (second edition) available at http://vistahigherlearning.com/store/uiowa.htm/taller-de-escritores-2nd-edition-1.html.

    "description": "Mexico City is the sprawling urban complex at the center of political and cultural life in of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived in 1519, Mexico-Tenochtitlan was among the largest urban centers in the world. The Aztec capital stunned the conquistadors with its size and beauty: built across islands in an interlocking system of alpine lakes at the bottom of a wide basin formed by smoking volcanoes, it was a tropical Venice in the New World. The city's stunning surroundings famously led the Mexican intellectual Alfonso Reyes to dub his nation's capital \"la región más transparente.\" During its long history, Mexico City has been repeatedly transformed. The lakes were largely drained over the course of many decades. Industrialization and huge traffic snarls have choked the air. Throughout, Mexico City has been a global city and a place where Spanish American cultural life has flowed and left indelible marks. This class will make a broad historical overview of Mexico City. Readings and materials will include first-person narratives by Spanish conquistadors, texts by colonial and native intellectuals, and work by more contemporary writers, such as short stories, novels, essays, and journalistic pieces as well as works by musicians and filmmakers. Grading will be based on active class participation, two partial exams, two short essays, and a collaborative final project that addresses key themes and materials addressed in the course.\n This course is taught in Spanish.

Class activities consist of lectures, commentaries on readings, and group presentations.  Grading is based on participation, written responses to readings, a group presentation,  a midterm and a final project. \nThis course is approved for the Latina/o Studies minor.  See the Latina/o Studies website for more information about the minor.",

Every Native American nation has its own understanding of the how they came to occupy certain places within North America as well as what their relationships and responsibilities are to everything that exists in their homelands such as drawings etched on cave walls or raindrops that fall from the sky.  In this course we explore what those relationships look like and how they have changed or been affected over time by the introduction of western values, resource development, and population growth in areas of limited resources such as water or grazing lands.  We will also talk about innovative ways in which Native American communities are restoring those relationships damaged by resource development and manufacturing. Course requirements include a midterm and final examination and a poster project that students will work on throughout the semester.  The students will also have three short assignments (two written and one oral) addressing some aspect of their poster project.\nTextbooks and Materials:  Books will be available through the University Bookstore and articles and chapters will be accessible on the course ICON site.",

Why do people listen or watch a music video even if they don’t know what it says? Or What do people enjoy in the music even when they have no clue to what it says? This course is designed to introduce students to the meaning and relationship between culture, language ideology, gender, economy, religion, history and politics of Swahili culture through music. Swahili culture is examined in multiple lenses, through which outside influences have their impact. This can be observed when immersing in the Swahili speaking communities or through other resources such as music, media, movies, films etc. This course will use Swahili music as a way of connecting and understanding the culture of the Swahili speaking communities; looking at how the themes, beats, and movement send messages to the audience.",

    "description": "In Creativity for a Lifetime, students will learn the significance of creativity in human happiness and success. Creativity is part of what makes us human, and understanding the creative process is relevant to all of us. In this course, we will examine questions about big ideas, such as: What is creativity and how can we be more creative? What can we learn from closely examining our own and others’ creative work? What is the role of creativity across the human lifespan? How can creative work be a part of healthy adult life and healthy aging? We will especially consider the lives and work of artists. Because artists intensively imagine things that don’t yet exist, understanding artist’s experiences will enhance innovation and imagination. Students in the arts, liberal arts, sciences, and social sciences can apply the experience gained from studying the outcomes of creativity and working with established artists to other academic disciplines.\nStudents will engage in activities and projects as opposed to lectures and exams. Taught in an active-learning TILE classroom, Creativity for a Lifetime brings together the knowledge, skills, and life experiences of students and faculty members interested in an array of disciplines, including art and art history, anthropology, education, rhetoric, social work, aging studies, and the health sciences. To better appreciate the elements of successful aging, the richness of life-long learning, and an appreciation of the role of creative endeavor throughout a lifespan, students will meet Iowa artists and collect their oral histories.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

    "description": "This course explores the idea that to learn to teach writing best, we must write and read; these acts cannot be disconnected. Students read and discuss accounts by professional writers, student writers, teachers of writing, and writing researchers. The discipline of composition studies, as well as reflections by writers on writing, is rich with interesting documentation, important theory, and vigorous dialogue. Students write for an audience to read and respond, in a broad variety of genres including the personal essay, the poem, short fiction, short nonfiction, the letter, the one-pager, and an experimental blur of genres. Writing is one tool for working out thinking. It is a link between inner speech and a frame for talk, a link between writer/speakers and reader/listeners. It is a writing teacher's responsibility to create an environment that ensures a diet of varied writing and broad reading, a community of rich, specific responders, and lots of opportunities for revising and careful editing. Along with the development of the individual writer-reader, the \"social construction of knowledge\" is an important concept in a writing class, and students experience it in this course. There are no actual stages, there is no specific process, but we can describe and theorize about prewriting techniques, revision strategies, conferencing models, inventories of grammatical conventions and mechanics, and publishing opportunities. Describing writing allows us to freeze the action to discover conditions under which writing takes place, and what the differences are in every writer's approach. To teach writing, you need to see that the act of writing is different with each piece you write, that you contribute to the next piece you write with each piece you read.\nEnglish majors may apply this course to the following area and/or period requirement. Area: Nonfiction and Creative Writing.",

    "description": "Museums collect and preserve artifacts and objects from our world while reflecting the values, creativity, and aspirations of human culture. This course provides an overview of the past and present of museums while presenting possibilities for the future. Using case studies from a wide range of museums (e.g., art, history, natural history, science, culturally specific) this course will presents the foundations of museum studies and examines best practices and approaches to collection and curatorial practice; governance and operations; audience and community engagement; and ethical issues. This course also explores the wide range of career pathways available in the field and gives students hands-on experience through a service-learning project. This course engages students in activities and dialogue that contribute to a larger conversation about the significant role museums play in our society.",

    "description": "In this course, we study the development of mathematical knowledge from ancient times to the present. We will focus, in particular, on the origin and development of the mathematics with which you are already familiar. Because many of these subjects are central to the elementary and secondary mathematics curriculum, their history should be of particular interest to current or prospective mathematics teachers. But we will also explore new areas of mathematics that you may not have encountered before. The course is intended to help you:\n\n\nDescribe the origins and development of core mathematical subjects such as number systems, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus.\nUnderstand that mathematics is not created in a vacuum, but is done by real people, living under particular social, historical, political, and personal conditions.\nExplain how problems arising in science, technology, and mathematics itself give rise to new mathematical ideas and branches of study.\n\n\nNote: this course has one online proctored examination. Local students will take exams in the DCE Testing Center (no charge). Off-campus students will take exams using an online proctored exam service. Off-campus students must have access to a computer with a webcam and headset/microphone in a quiet/private location. Off-campus students are responsible for proctoring fees (up to $20 per exam).This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.  Current UI students should register directly on MyUI.  Students who are not admitted to the UI click here to proceed. Contact 319-335-2575 or dce-registration@uiowa.edu for assistance.",

    "description": "This course studies curves and surfaces in Euclidean space, and introduces the notion of differentiable manifolds. Extrinsic properties of surfaces in Euclidean space are studied, and related to the intrinsic geometry of these surfaces. This lays the foundation for the introduction of abstract surfaces. Students also examine various curvature functions and extremal objects; for example, distance and energy minimizing curves on surfaces, and area minimizing surfaces. The aim is to reach the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. The course may use computers (and specifically, Mathematica) as a visual tool to understand geometry intuitively. No previous knowledge of Mathematica is required, but a general familiarity with computers can be useful. The ideas from this subject have applications in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines. The course is taught by a faculty member.",

In addition to the topics from the catalogue, we will take up current applications that are relevant to the thesis projects and graduate plans of the students who sign up. The course will be individualized; we will follow your interests. There will be take-home exams, individualized too, and individual student projects. The material in this course is core to a lot of things you will encounter in your graduate career, be it pure or applied, be it analysis or one of the other areas, or neighboring areas of mathematics. Functional analysis is used in representation theory, in operator theory/operator algebras (unbounded operators in Hilbert space, index theory, in the theory of unitary representations of groups, in geometry, physics, to mention only a few). And it is used in harmonic analysis, in number theory, in numerical analysis, and in PDE, in dynamics, in statistics and probability, in engineering topics, and in mathematical physics.  Details about coursework and TH exams will be in the course syllabus.",

    "description": "Even in a country that values the separation of Church and State, the Bible has a profound influence on virtually every aspect of our political and personal lives. The debate over the role that the Bible plays in our culture is not just one between true believers and atheists, but more importantly also among various groups that would consider themselves to be “true believers.” Should the Bible play such an important role in determining right and wrong in our culture? Which group’s interpretation of the Bible is the correct one? How can we even know?\nFirst year seminars are designed to introduce students to the changes and developments expected in college work from high school. Focusing on critical and analytical skills, this course examines how people can interpret the exact same passages to reach different conclusions about how they and others should live. Each week students will read prominent biblical passages and various interpretations to foster class discussion about the Bible’s influence on important issues that range from social justice and gender equality to marriage and homosexuality. Student grades are based on attendance, participation, short writing assignments, in-class group projects, and a short meeting with the instructor to discuss a topic of their choosing.",

    "description": "Introduction to Islamic Civilization is a historical survey of Islamic institutions, communities, literature, arts, sciences, cultures, and practices since the 7th century. This course is for students with an interest in learning about the Islamic civilization, the religious practices and beliefs, and/or the history or the regions where Muslims are in the majority.  We will examine the traditions and main social and legal institutions of Islam. Arguably, Islam, as a major system of beliefs and practices in the world, affects both Muslims and non-Muslims. Consequently, besides examining the basic tenets, texts, and ideas of the Islamic civilization, this course focuses on the variety of ways in which Muslims and non-Muslims have understood and interpreted Islam. We will review the discussions surrounding the life of the Prophet of Islam, Islamic pre-modern and modern history, the place and role of individuals and society, the legal and economic status of women, and Islamic governments and movements. As a survey course, we will examine these topics through an interdisciplinary approach: we will apply textual, legal/normative, anthropological, geographical, sociological, analytical, linguistic, and historical methodologies. \nOne of the aims of this course is to give voice to Islamic texts and provide a window into how Muslims, in varying socio-historical contexts, view themselves and how they view others. We will address specific topics such as Islamic doctrines and law, philosophy, Sufi mysticism, Islamic science and arts, gender issues, politics, the ongoing debate between modernism and traditionalism in contemporary Islamic societies, and Islam in the West. The course is ultimately an attempt to understand Islam as an idea and as a process, never as a static and crystallized snapshot of the world through the eyes of any specific group inside or outside the Muslim community.\nMinimally, students will learn basic definitions of key terms and concepts, identify major social and political trends, locate demographic and political centers within the Islamic world, understand legal and philosophical norms, contextualize historical events, expose hidden and public tensions within and without Muslim and/or non-Muslim communities, and acquire a basic understanding of the origins, developments, and limits of the Islamic civilization.",

Do you wonder about why people eat certain things at certain times of the year, why people pray, why they raise their families in certain ways? If you wonder about any of these things THEN THIS IS THE CLASS FOR YOU!\nWe will explore together commonalities as well as differences among religious and spiritual groups in the United States today including evangelical Protestant Christians and Roman Catholics; Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews; and Muslims.  We will also learn about less well known groups and adherents such as the Amish, Zen Buddhists, Scientologists, Jehovah Witnesses, and snakehandling Holiness-Pentecostals, as well as the beliefs of agnosticism and atheism.\nClass Format: \nThe format for this class is facilitated learning. We will have in-class discussions in which we share our views and learn together. Because this is a General Education class, you will take away some important skills that will help you in other classes and in life. Reading and writing skills, short in-class presentations, and group work are some of the things we will address in this class. Dr. Kristy is a passionate teacher who invites you to share her interest in understanding the world in which we live and each other’s religious, spiritual, and cultural backgrounds.\nClass Assignments:\nAssignments include: Four short analysis papers on class readings; a family spiritual-religious heritage paper; short quizzes; a final “Religion in Iowa City” report and 3-minute in-class presentation. All of the readings are in a Course Reader available for purchase at Zephyr Copy Shop downtown Iowa City.",

How this point is exploited is examined in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilych,\" Clarke's Childhood's End, the Book of Ecclesiastes, the E'numa E'lish, and Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nUpon completing this course, students should be able to (a) reflect on how various quests for meaning in life as expressed in literature relate to the human condition, with particular attention to matters relating to the table, the bedroom, and the grave; (b) specify the dangers in making generalizations about biblical texts and the individuals and groups that hold them to be sacred; (c) indicate how fundamental human questions such as \"Where do we come from?\", \"Where are we going?\", and \"How long do we have?\" are expressed from the contrasting viewpoints of the pagan and biblical visions.\nIn addition to reading materials and interactive tools, online content includes audio slideshows and video (recorded class lectures of Professor Jay Holstein); evaluation consists of one writing assignment and online assessments by way of multiple-choice quizzes, midterm, and final exams, all of which are accessed in the ICON course management system.

    "description": "The first three centuries after Jesus’ death saw Christianity grow from a small Jewish sect into a largely gentile religion that spanned the Roman world. But, did you know that the idea of a single united Church has never been a historical reality? From the earliest generations, Christians debated and fought over such issues as the exact nature of Jesus, whether or not they had to be Jewish, and even whether it was the teaching or the death of Jesus that brought salvation. In an age of sectarian dispute, how could you know which group had the “true” message and path to salvation? Since Jesus wrote nothing himself, authority was sought through his apostles and closest associates. And, since they did not have armies, their battles over authority were waged through narratives. This course will examine these battles over authority by analyzing several of the early Christian gospels, both canonical (e.g. Matthew and John) and non-canonical (e.g. Thomas, Mary, and Judas), paying particular attention to the depiction of Jesus and his apostles. Student grades will be based on attendance and participation, several short reflective and analytical papers, a group project, and a take home exam.",

    "description": "Economics of religion is a thriving field of study that examines socio- economic theories and methods to explain the religious behavioral patterns of individuals, groups or cultures and the social consequences of such behavior. Religious economics is a related subject sometimes conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious principles to evaluate economic perspectives and practices. In Economics of Religion, we will draw on these and other emerging areas of inquiry to explore the origins and functions of religious economic ideas in Islamic, Christian, and Jewish societies throughout history.\n \nSpecifically, after the financial crisis of 2008, scholars paid more attention to the role of religion in sustaining economic development and inspiring financial institutions to offer religion-compliant products and services. Limits on interest-based loans to the growing Muslim community in Western societies forced many banking and investment organization to create shari`a-compliant products and services. The success of Islamist governments in Turkey and Iran to create thriving middle and entrepreneurial classes brought to focus the relationship between religious belief and economics. Globalization, too, played a significant role in raising the profile of religion-inspired financial endeavors, services, and products. Students will be introduced to these and related themes in this highly multidisciplinary course.\n \nThis course is about the origins, functions and impact of Islamic and other religions' ideas and practices in the realms of economic development, financial services and products, business ethics and practices, and business models. Students will explore the ways such ideas and practices affect legacy issues like property rights, poverty, and access to healthcare, education, and social security. Lastly, students will examine the impact of religious ideas and practices on social justice matters that touch on individual and group identity along class, gender, ethnicity, and race, as well as, the role of religion in formulating public policy and directing international relations.

    "description": "Religious and spiritual healing have been deployed as a major part of medical practice for thousands of years and, conversely, healing has been a major part of religious practice for as long as religion has existed. Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.",

From his conservative upbringing in a small city in Western India, to his early career as a London-trained lawyer, to his transformative experiences working with Indian laborers in South Africa and then his epochal role in the Indian freedom struggle and self-transformation into a charismatic mahatma (“great soul”)—Gandhi’s fascinating odyssey helped shape some of the 19th and 20th centuries most momentous events, even as his abiding concern for an ethical and embodied politics anticipated social movements and themes that continue to resonate in the 21st century: the pursuit of political and social liberation through non-violent civil disobedience, the assertion of human rights, and the quest for sustainable lifestyles that uphold the common good and protect the natural environment. We will consider the evolution of Gandhi’s thought and activism in historical perspective through selected writings (including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, and his manifesto Hind Swaraj) and will examine his legacy as reflected in a variety of sources and media, including both Western and Indian feature films, the American civil rights movement and South African anti-apartheid struggle, and in critical responses to Gandhi, both positive and negative.",

Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations.

    "description": "This course offers students a broad overview of the role nonprofit organizations play in building and enhancing local communities. Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations. Students will be graded on discussion forums, short writing assignments, and a final strategic plan.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "We all know Star Trek, but what explains it as a pop culture phenomenon? What started as the adventures of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock has become one the most successful media franchises in TV and movie history. Why do we love its heroes, villains, and aliens? The class begins with a look at the original series (1966-69) and moves to The Next Generation (1987-1994). Our primary emphasis is on the characters of Star Trek and how their development illustrates themes related to the future, technology, sexuality, race, gender, and the nature of what it means to be human. Creator Gene Roddenberry’s original concept of the show as a “Western in Space,” combines elements of campy science fiction, existential conflict, and progressive social thought to portray humanity’s best and worst traits. Through comparisons of characters such as Captains Kirk and Picard, Officers Spock and Data, female crew members such as Uhura, Yar, and Troi, and the portrayal of enemies such as the Klingons, the Borg, and the God-like figure of Q, students will come to understand how the series both reinforces and breaks gender and racial stereotypes while conceptualizing human interaction in a continuously original, thought-provoking way. Star Trek’s genius is that it makes the unknown both knowable and accessible. Study guides will accompany each episode to facilitate preparation and discussion. Grading is based on papers and class participation.",

Moreover, estimates indicate that being overweight or obese will become the leading cause of death and outweigh the health benefits resulting from improved therapies and continued reductions in the prevalence of behavioral risk factors, such as smoking. In this course, we will first discuss the reasons for the obesity epidemic and why weight loss is so difficult to achieve. We will then discuss how obesity contributes to the development of cardiovascular, metabolic, and neoplastic diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, diabetes and some types of cancer. Finally we will touch upon the psychological and socioeconomic consequences of the obesity epidemic. For each class meeting a specific topic directly or indirectly related to obesity will be covered. Students are required to research this topic on their own before coming to class. During class, students will then discuss the topic. The instructor will serve as moderator. Besides the actual topic, students will also discuss the sources of their information and how reliable these sources are. The course is graded on a letter grade scale. To foster a lively discussion during class time, the oral participation in the discussion sessions will not be graded. For grading, students are required to turn in one-page summaries of three discussion sessions throughout the semester.",

    "description": "Are you a seeker or a chaser? Did the Hufflepuff Newt Scamander come to New York City to purchase a birthday present, return Frank, a trafficked Thunderbird, to his native Arizona desert, or to find Grindelwald? We might even ask whose story this is. Newt Scamander’s, Gellert Grindelwald’s, or the fantastic beasts who populate Newt’s suitcase and wreak havoc in New York City? In this first year seminar we will critique J.K. Rowling’s screenplay Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the accompanying film as a means to explore issues of poverty, segregation, friendship, politics, journalism, industry, commerce, jazz, art, and zoology in 1920s New York City. We will investigate the ways in which the American wizarding and non-wizarding worlds co-exist and collide.\nIn Jacob Kowalski we find our first non-magical hero. What do he and Newt learn from one another? How do the social outcasts Newt, Tina, Queenie, and Jacob develop a formidable team that fights the incompetence of Macusa? We will analyze the role in which the niffler, murtlap, bowtruckle, occamy, and other beasts play in bringing the team together. In our discussion of the New Salem Philanthropic Society we will look at how rejection and abuse leads to anger turned inward and as an obscurus outward. For those who have read the Harry Potter series we might question how Fantastic Beasts fills in details regarding Grindelwald’s rise to power, Newt’s research for the Hogwarts school text, or how social biases and prejudices are not limited to a geographic region or demographic. In this seminar we also learn how to utilize the University of Iowa Libraries catalog as a means to find books and online resources relevant to our research interests. Grades are based on class attendance, active participation, brief writing assignments, and a small research project.",

    "description": "Popular culture, the culture of ordinary people, functions both as a text and a context for our lives. Culture, as we live within it, changes us and the ways in which we perceive others and ourselves. Popular culture is also a text that we read, a collection of “signs” that point up value systems, ways of being, and ways to make sense of things. In short, then, we interpret through a cultural lens, and how we interpret both contributes to and is a product of who we are.\nBuilding upon this common intellectual foundation, in this course we will investigate the multiple identities that we create and assume in our public and private lives, the processes by which these identities may be created, the role of higher education in identity formation, and the effects of American popular culture upon our creating and living out these identities. Our cultural readings concern education, language use, gender, race and multiculturalism, class, mass/massless media, self-image, and material consumption. As we explore the issues contained in our texts, each of us may well reconstruct a clearer conception of who we are individually and collectively, and arrive at a deeper understanding of how we inhabit culture using these identities.",

What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi-tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget - and so important to repeat new information? Is it true that men and women have different brains?  As a guide to our discussions, we will read a New York Times Bestselling book, “Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School,” written by Dr. John Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and research consultant.  Students will participate in small group activities including hands-on dissection of sheep brains to identify key brain structures; self-analysis of work/sleep/exercise habits; and discussion of how these things and stress levels affect brain performance and learning.  We will explore practical ways to improve memory and develop visual attention.  We will also consider the effects of alcohol on the brain.  Short videos that accompany the book will provide supporting information to reinforce the main points.  Students will be evaluated on participation in discussions and activities within and outside the classroom, including charting personal work/sleep/exercise habits, weekly written assignments of about 1/2 page per week, and a final 2-page paper on a topic of the student’s choosing.",

    "description": "Nothing inspires the imagination like the future. Its wide-open possibilities allow us to look at today’s problems and see looming, not yet realized solutions. Futurology (also known as futurism or futures studies) weaves together examinations of past and present social and cultural trends with interests in science and science fiction. The result is a broad study of where we are going – as a society, as a species. In this course, we will consider such topics as: technology’s role in defining our everyday lives; sustainable architecture and the changing shape of cities; the rise of new professions (e.g. rewilder, nostalgist, and telesurgeon); and mutations in fashion, language, and pop culture.\nThis course is for dreamers and doers – those who remain unsatisfied with the present and want to lay hands on ever-changing terrain of what’s to come. As we enter that landscape, we will look to films (Blade Runner, The Singularity), novels (Neuromancer, Stand on Zanzibar), and an array of articles and essays that challenge our notions about what humanity is meant to do or be. We will consider how the world around us might be altered – for better or worse – and shape these thoughts into pragmatic plans for change. Over the course of the semester, students will routinely post their thoughts and findings to the course blog en route to a larger final presentation on a future trend of interest to them.\nOur classroom will be an environment of trust and respect. As a group, we will come to know one another quite well this semester. Each of us must be able to feel free to share and discuss anything we feel is pertinent, and no viewpoint respectful of others in the group will be silenced.

    "description": "Mt Everest has captured our imagination ever since it was discovered to be the highest mountain on earth. For years Mt Everest has been a cherished site for tales of adventure and bravery, but recent events on Everest, most notably several instances where dying climbers were left behind by guides and teammates, have cast a pall over the mountain. Climbers now tweet their way to the summit, and during the prelude to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, runners carried the Olympic torch to Everest’s summit in a show that was broadcast live from the top of the world. In 2014, an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas as they carried heavy loads through the most dangerous part of the mountain, drawing public attention to their perilous working conditions and resulting in the  cancellation of the climbing season.\nIn this course, we will develop our critical skills as we explore the changing cultural meanings of Mt. Everest. Using expedition accounts, excerpts from autobiographies, and expedition films, we will situate the recent events on Everest in the context of a history of the mountain that includes the 1924 British expedition during which George Mallory vanished; the \"conquest\" of Everest in 1953; and the tragic events of 1996 detailed in Jon Kraukauer's Into Thin Air. We will not be asking why people climb Everest (Mallory has already told us it is \"because it is there\"); we will be exploring how their exploits are framed for the rest of us. What is the effect of these stories, which are usually presented as tales of tragedy, courage, and heroism, and what sorts of cultural meanings are we supposed to take from them? How have ideas about Everest changed over time?\nWe will read Jon Krakauer’s Into Thin Air about the 1996 Everest climb and other readings by climbers scanned onto our ICON site. Grading will be based on participation in class, three reading journals turned in during the course of the semester, and a group report of a particular topic related to Everest.",

Course projects will help students find suitable, practical outlets for their creative and academic interests and abilities. In the class, students will learn about successful student-led initiatives that have been started and led by University of Iowa students, such as Dance Marathon (dancemarathon.uiowa.edu). Based upon assigned reading, discussion, and reflection, students will compose a personal engagement plan in which they set goals for themselves and identify the resources and skills they will need to accomplish those goals.\nGrades will be earned as follows:\n\nBeing prepared for each class: 15%\nParticipation: 15%\nPresentation on an organization student plans to join or start: 20%\nAttending two events and giving reports: 30%\nBrief final paper outlining goals for engagement: 20%",

We will also be vicariously experiencing physically challenging journeys by less popular modes of transport, e.g. bicycle, kayak, and foot. Unlike voyaging by plane, train, or car, “slow travel” enables closer, deeper, and more frequent contact with nature and with people. We will examine published literary travel essays and our own creative work for elements that make a text transcend the personal story. Taking advantage of Iowa City’s writing resources, we will read the work of a local travel writer who will visit the class to talk about his or her work. Through the readings and discussions, this course will help develop the cultural sensitivity so important for those studying at an international university and preparing to enter a global community. Tales of physical exertion and discomfort will challenge our notions of travel, leisure, and endurance. Discussions of readings will emphasize how a traveler’s perceptions of people and places are influenced by cultural values, by gender, race, and class, as well as by travel conditions such as climate, means of transport, and the traveler’s mental and physical preparation. Course requirements include creative exercises describing people, places, and travel experiences, including a field trip-hike to Coralville Lake; one longer travel essay; and oral and written responses (on a course blog) to published and peer work.",

The overwhelming scientific explanation, contrary to what is sometimes reported in the popular press, is that human actions are a primary factor in causing climate change. Climate scientists explain what is happening to the planet. It takes psychological scientists to offer explanations into why people behave the way they do, even when the consequences of their behavior can be dire for their future. It takes psychological scientists to offer practices for changing behavior. In this seminar, we will apply basic principles of psychological science to observe and explain how human behaviors contribute to climate change and unsustainable practices. Topics will include the thinking patterns, or “heuristics,” from cognitive psychology that make us less than rational decision makers; the influence of groups on the individual, studied by social psychologists, in which groups influence one’s attitudes and behaviors; and the best practices for behavioral change based on principles of learning. The seminar will involve field visits to observe and experience sustainable behaviors in practice, such as helping with prairie seed collection, visiting a sustainable energy production site, or visiting a local sustainable-practices farm. Course evaluation will be based on (but not necessarily limited to) written responses to assigned readings, a behavioral observation journal, and in-class discussion. Students are encouraged to co-enroll in Elementary Psychology (PSY1001), and those students will receive honors credit for both this first-year seminar and Elementary Psychology.",

Many paleontologists - scientists who study life of the geological past - were drawn to the field by pictures of dinosaurs. But how much do these reconstructions accurately reflect what we believe the past was like, and how much do they reflect the time of the artist? How deeply have they been affected by cultural metaphors? How do they influence public perception of science and scientists? And how would you depict the distant past? Paleontology - the study of life of the geological past - gives us a unique opportunity to examine the interaction between science and popular culture. This seminar will take advantage of this opportunity by looking at artistic expressions of past life. Students will see how science has progressed, sometimes in parallel with its cultural milieu and sometimes in opposition to it.",

Our politics is often described as polarizing, and too often the way that we try and talk about public issues only makes this problem worse. What we need is not less talk but better talk. This course will briefly study what kinds of talk help communities solve problems together and will cultivate in students using game design to help groups talk about difficult issues. While we will spend some serious time at play, course assignments will introduce students to college-level work through short papers and a group game design final project. Students who are interested in public policy, community engagement, and politics will enjoy this class. Students will also have the option to continue their work and test their game as interns with the Iowa Program for Public Life.",

InterPlay, founded 25 years ago by Phil Porter and Cynthia Winton-Henry, is an easy-to-learn, creative process based on eight common sense tools or ideas such as incrementality (breaking things down into small steps), and affirmation (looking for the good and naming the good). InterPlay is strength-based and invites participants to express themselves through “forms” such as a one-hand dance and babbling, which is a simple type of storytelling. These forms are done with partners, in small groups, and with the full group. We regularly “notice” or talk about what we experienced as we play with the forms. You will reflect on in-class activities and read about the relationship between energy patterns and personality characteristics. The class text includes a self-assessment tool to explore our primary and secondary energy patterns, and with this information, we can more easily interact with others in groups and connect with people.",

    "description": "Fans around the world revere J. R. R. Tolkien as the creator of one of the most imaginative, gripping, and self-contained fictional worlds, “Middle-Earth,” the setting of his novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Many do not know that he benefited for nearly 20 years from a lively group of friends who met weekly at a pub in Oxford, England, to discuss literature and read their works in progress. This literary club was called the Inklings, and it counted among its members other celebrated writers including Charles Williams and C. S. Lewis, author of The Chronicles of Narnia.\nThis First-Year Seminar is dedicated to exploring the works of Tolkien in the context of the friendships and conversations among the Inklings and in the larger political, social, and religious contexts of the 1930s and 1940s. We will read and discuss Tolkien’s fiction and essays alongside accounts of the Inklings and their discussions and ideas. Along the way we will ask several interrelated questions: how did Tolkien influence the fantasy literature of the twentieth century? Why were ancient myths and poems like Beowulf so important to him, and why did he feel myth and fantasy were so important for modern readers? What role did his friendships and the political contexts of the two World Wars play in shaping Middle-Earth? What is the role of friendship in artistic creation and literary enjoyment?\nGrades in this seminar will be based on leading a class discussion on one of our readings, on lively participation in discussion each week, and on various components of a brief research paper which will be read at our final conference, “Middle-Earth and the Inklings: Celebrating the Worlds of J. R. R. Tolkien.”",

    "description": "A new cultural phenomenon began in 1997 when Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was released. Copies flew off store shelves as readers of all ages were captivated by Harry’s story. It was as though the novel had been rediscovered and reading became everyone’s favorite activity. Subsequent volumes continued to mesmerize readers, and soon thereafter they listened to audio versions and watched cinematic adaptations. Why was the Harry Potter series so appealing? What was it about Harry’s story or that of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Dobby, or Neville Longbottom’s that resonated with such a diverse populace? How and why did readers develop deep personal connections to the series? How was Pottermania created and sustained?\nIn this course we will analyze the Harry Potter series for the insights it provides on friendship, loyalty, finance, the law, social justice, ethnicity, social media, sports (Quidditch), music (The Weird Sisters), and our relationship with animals and their world. Through a close reading of the novels we will consider their place in the literary canon. We will also pinpoint where influences from this canon can be found in the novels. Finally, we will study the Harry Potter series as a cultural phenomenon. We will analyze the impact the series had on readership and popular culture in America and Great Britain.\nThis honors course is taught by lecturer Donna Parsons (http://music.uiowa.edu/people/donna-parsons). If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may contact the course instructor in order to request permission to enroll.",

It is also typically the place where actors can be themselves and “real conversations” occur.\nIn that same spirit, The Green Room course is designed to provide an environment where students engage in meaningful discussions, cultivate their innate curiosity, and have space to self-reflect.\nEvidence shows that creative solutions depend on the breadth, not just the depth, of one’s knowledge and involvement. Through stories, speakers, reflective writing, and a series of new experiences, The Green Room asks students to explore beyond their chosen academic major. While we all must bear responsibility for making our way in the world, The Green Room encourages students to leave a window open for something deeper: figuring out who you are, why you’re here, and what you came to do.\nThe University of Iowa, Iowa City, and your Honors peers all provide a canvas to challenge and develop your ideas.

In this class, you will work on one of these projects. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about U.S. foreign policy by engaging in research relevant to the U.S. government. The goals of this class are for you to understand what types of issues the U.S. State Department deals with and the type of information it needs. You will also understand how research can inform policy decisions and how you conduct research. The final goal is to help you develop research, writing, presentation, and group work skills.\nTo accomplish these goals, you will be assigned into one of two groups. Each group will work on a project. You will be provided readings to provide you some background for your research area. In addition, you will work on your research topic in class and outside of class. A few times during the semester, your group will be required to present on the status of your project to the rest of the class. You will be evaluated on your work within your group project during class periods.

    "description": "Established a millennium ago, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has a headmaster who is the greatest wizard of the age.  It has distinct houses for educating students in skills and values that trace to its four famous founders.  Yet it also has histories, secrets, and ghosts that haunt its students and the larger society to the point of catastrophe.  Oh, and now it has Harry Potter, to help defend it by facing the evil mage who embodies these terrible troubles.\nThe haunted house that is Hogwarts Castle is an emblem of the Western Civilization where we live, while J. K. Rowling’s seven novels about Hogwarts and Harry Potter feature the politics of our times in the West.  In Hogwarts terms, politics are the dark arts — but also our defenses against them.  So teach the Sophists, Machiavellians, Nietzscheans, and more.  For three decades, Harry Potter books and films have taught defenses against politics prominent in our dark times.  Each work reveals troubles at the foundations of Hogwarts and the West.  Each explores responses to these troubles.  So each examines crucial aspects of our politics:  authority, bureaucracy, charisma, culture, education, freedom, power, science, time, tradition, and truth.  Addressing the challenges for Harry Potter and his friends, the course analyzes political paths of conformism versus perfectionism, idealism versus realism, and fascism versus populism.\nThe seven novels are easy but long, and we (re)read them at the rate of one every two weeks.  We also add a chapter a week from two classics of political theory about the possibility of Western Civilization in ending in our times.  These collect essays From Max Weber as well as Between Past and Future by Hannah Arendt.  Classes are mainly for us to discuss the politics in each novel’s situations, characters, and deeds.  We specify their links to our political situations, and we debate their issues for current action.  Students might have the Potter books already or be able to acquire them quickly; the Weber and Arendt books are available from the University Bookstore in the Iowa Memorial Union.  Each student takes short-answer quizzes on the Potter politics discussed in class, and each writes three exercises to analyze political issues and motifs in the Potter novels.If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may contact the course instructor in order to request permission to enroll.",

Yet the interaction between China and the rest of the world, particularly the Western world, is often challenged by misperceptions, stereotypes, biases, fear and even ignorance on both sides. The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how China has achieved its fast growth, the problems that are troubling its further development and interaction with the outside world, and its future role in international politics.\nThis course is divided into three components. First, it will review the historical legacies of Chinese society, including the 19th century encounter with the Western world, the communist revolution, the Cultural Revolution, the 1989 Tiananmen protest, and how these legacies contribute to the recent domestic political developments and Chinese foreign policy in the 21st century. Second, it will examine the current Chinese political system, its political culture and the relationship between the state and the public. Third, the course will look into several political, social and economic policies and their consequences. We will cover some hot topics in Chinese politics and society, including economic inequality, ethnic relations, freedom of press and media, contentious politics, gender and women rights, and among others.",

    "description": "How is viral media changing politics and news? With digital media, the public’s demand for around the clock real-time news has skyrocketed. Over the past twenty years newsroom staff has declined by nearly 40% according to Pew, but there has been a dramatic increase in how much is written about leading 2016 presidential candidates. Donald Trump has received nearly three times more media attention than his opponents, equivalent to $2 billion in free media coverage, compared to $746 million for Hillary Clinton and $321 million Bernie Sanders (based on a company that uses advertising ratings to assign a dollar to the media coverage candidates receive). This is hybrid media. Trump’s Twitter campaigning generates tremendous coverage by both traditional journalists and digital only media outlets, and then is consumed by readers online who want streaming news around-the clock and televisions viewers. There is blurring of digital and traditional media and a feedback loop between the two.\nThis course is about the media and politics. The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, and most Americans believe that a free press is an essential condition for both liberty and democratic politics. The media play a central role in American politics, not only in setting the agenda of topics that Americans think about and discuss but also in swaying public opinion on political issues and politicians. The course surveys the role of media in U.S. and global politics with a focus on social media. It includes two midterm exams and one take home final.\nIn the twenty-first century information access and participation in society are increasingly digital, as news, jobs, education and politics moves online. Interactive online networking platforms such as Twitter, Facebook--are transforming politics from electoral campaigns, to democratic protests, to the news media. Social media is how many people find the news and get informed. What are the consequences of this fundamental change in media for politics and society? \nTopics include inequality in access to the Internet (the \"digital divide\"), hybrid media and politics (from the New York Times to Wikileaks), social media and Twitter, big data and electoral campaigns, political participation, organizing, social movements and netroots, democratic protests, security and privacy and more. \nPolitics is about power. Political actors who use traditional and digital media to their advantage gain power, while those less effective at the new hybrid media lose out. While social media has many benefits, it also had costs, including replicating societal inequalities based on race and economic class, privacy and security, and reduced tolerance for others.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

This class provides you with the tools necessary to analyze and solve these and other puzzles in politics.  Unlike most political analyses you will encounter in life, which tyically are based on some mushy combination of “intuition” and “experience,” we will approach these questions from a rigorous framework, building up a set of simple tools that can help illuminate politics (both in its usual public sense and in the interpersonal sense that happens when a group of people decide who will do the dishes).\nThis course has no prerequisites.  No substantive knowledge about politics is assumed (in fact, thinking you already understand politics will probably work against you in this class). In terms of mathematical difficulty, the most difficult thing we will do (besides adding, subtracting, etc) is subtracting negative numbers and doing some algebra, and even that rarely. Instead, the key is the willingness to work with abstract terms and think logically about how the world works.\nRequired reading materials will be available online.",

The states also do things first, often adopting laws before the national government. Numerous states adopted women’s suffrage at the turn of the 19th Century, for example, decades before the federal government allowed women to vote. While the past thirty years have seen an unprecedented resurgence of the states in political power, policy responsibility and institutional capacity, the states have been critical in the U.S. from the beginning of the republic. Indeed, the very name of our nation indicates the pivotal place of the states in its governance. A goal of this course to introduce you to the study of politics in the American states in the 21st Century.  \nThroughout the course we will use the comparative method, comparing politics and policy across states to understand what causes this variation. State politics is all about comparisons--large states to small states, the sun belt to the rust belt, wealthy to poor, etc. The course explains why states and communities vary [in terms of institutions/economics/demographics/ politics/policy] in the ways they do. Topics include voting, elections, cultures, demography, political parties, policy, legislatures, governors, the courts, direct democracy and much more related to the fifty American states.\n This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

Students who have taken either POLI:3121 (Judicial Process), POLI:3120 (Criminal Justice System), or similar courses, should be well-prepared for POLI:3101, but such courses are not necessary for success in this course.   Further information can be obtained in the Courses section at www.profhagle.com.  (Includes additional textbook information and the most recent previous syllabus.)",

    "description": "In the past year, many have watched the U.S. Congress with a mix of fascination and disdain. Americans tend to dislike Congress more than the Presidency or the Supreme Court. Congress even reached an all-time low rating of 5% (that is, only 1/20 Americans approved of Congress!) after the government shutdown of 2013. Much of what Congress does seems mysterious, confusing, unnecessarily slow and filled with partisan nastiness. Battles over health care legislation and midterm elections that bring big change only reinforce these perceptions. But is this really how Congress is? In this class, we'll uncover the history of Congress, how congressional elections shape what legislators do, how laws are made in Congress, the rules and maneuvers that shape these laws, and the future of Congress as one of the major institutions of American government. Our goal will be to understand Congress and explain why Americans continue to be both confused and fascinated by this complicated branch and its politics.\nGrades will be based on weekly on-line quizzes and three essay exams. The latter will be `take-home' style exams with open book and notes. Because of the quick nature of the course, 48 hours will be given for each exam.\n \n This section is offered at the Iowa Center for Higher Education through Distance and Online Education.

This course provides an overview of the major problems facing American democracy from polarized political parties and money in politics (under Citizens United), to low voter turnout and trust in government, to the growing gap between the super rich and the middle class, and how this effects elected officials. We will focus on solving these problems, including the movement towards digital politics and new media, participatory democracy, to reform of congressional elections and non-partisan redistricting, presidential elections (Electoral College), presidential nomination process, campaign finance, voter registration and voting (EDR, early voting, mail voting), proportional representation and much more. The class covers concrete ideas about how to rejuvenate democracy (with a small \"d\") in America. The goal of the class is to create a top 10 list of election reforms by the last day of class.

This course teaches you everything you need to know about women and politics in the U.S. We cover three main topics. First, we examine how women got political rights in the U.S. in the suffrage movement, the debate over the Equal Rights Amendment, and more. Second, we look at current women in U.S. politics as voters, political participants, candidates, and office-holders. Third, we investigate public policies that significantly affect women in the U.S., such as reproductive policy, education, sexual violence, workplace rights, and more.\nGrades in this class are based on two non-cumulative essay exams – a midterm and a final. There is also a 5-7 page paper. Class is primarily lecture and discussion, with some media content (movies, online resources, etc). There are no prerequisites for this course.",

    "description": "The founders wanted a presidency that was strong enough to carry out the law, represent the United States in foreign affairs, and check the excesses of Congress, but not so strong as to become a tyrannical threat. The office they created possesses many traits that protect it from legislative encroachment but lacks the tools of powerful leadership.\nToday, presidents are routinely expected to lead the United States in addressing its many problems, and they are judged harshly when they fall short of those expectations. How did we as a nation come to this place where leadership is demanded but ‘followership’ is routinely withheld? And how have presidents tried to fulfill the expectations of leadership that have been thrust on the office despite its institutional weaknesses?\nThis course examines the constitutional origins and historical development of the presidency. It reviews the evolution of the presidential selection process and the development of the organizational structure and powers of the office. It concludes by considering the role of the presidency in modern America, and the means by which presidents try to fulfill that role in relation to Congress, the public, and the rest of the nation.\nThere are no prerequisites for this class, but a general knowledge of the workings of American politics (as might be obtained by taking a course like 30:001 Introduction to American Politics) would be useful.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "Since 2014, when it annexed Crimea and began supporting rebel forces in eastern Ukraine, Russia has returned as a major concern of American foreign policy. Russia has been assertive in various ways and tried to play the role of a great power, despite operating from relative economic, military and diplomatic weakness. The need for a carefully crafted policy on Russia is strong, and U.S. leaders are divided about what that policy should be. Any sensible policy must rest on understanding how Russians themselves see the world and what influences their decision making.\nThe goal of the course is for students to master core knowledge about Russia and its external behaviors and to practice using that knowledge to interpret Russian foreign policy. Students begin by investigating four sources from which Russia’s foreign policy springs: what they understand their national interests to be; their national identity as shaped by their history; the politics that produces their policies; and the capabilities Russia has to influence external events. The course then turns to case studies of Russian policy toward the United States, China and the near abroad (the former Soviet republics along Russia’s borders such as Ukraine).\nUnderstanding Russia’s international behavior can benefit all future citizens and should be particularly valuable for those who will go into government service, the non-profit sector, journalism, the military, or international business. Students should also leave the course more reflective about U.S. foreign policy, or the foreign policy of the country with which they are most familiar, by virtue of having learned how Russians see world affairs.  \nThis course fulfills a requirement for the following degrees or programs:\n\nPolitical Science\nInternational Relations (Regional Politics and Relationships)\nInternational Studies (Russian, East European and Eurasian)\nInternational Business Certificate (International Relations and Institutions)\n\nClass sessions will include lectures, discussions, videos and group activities. Grades will be based on a midterm, two short written assignments, class participation and a final exam.\nTextbooks: All assigned readings are available from the Main Library’s Reserve Desk or are on the internet or are on the course ICON site.",

    "description": "A variety of film genres have explored the causes and effects of war. This has ranged from documentaries about wars and battles, historical fiction, dramas, comedies, dramadies, to dark comedies and satire. These films have also emerged from, and been produced by individuals from several different cultures. This class will explore how diverse films examine, represent, and interrogate war. We will watch films like the Battle of Algiers (a historical war film about France’s efforts to stop urban terrorism in Algeria), Saving Private Ryan (historical fiction that realistically portrays combat in World War 2), Thirteen Days (a historical thriller about the Cuban Missile Crisis), 300 (a fictionalized account of a famous ancient battle), Tropic Thunder (a dark and satirical comedy about war movies themselves), and others. Assigned readings will help guide discussions about how these films portray particular themes of warfare. For example, we will read a book chapter about representations of \"buddies\" in war and then explore how 300 examines camaraderie and courage in battles, drawing on scenes depicting how King Leonidas treats the disabled Ephialtes and the structure and strategy of the military phalanx). Evaluations of student learning will be based on participation, two exams, two short essays, and two group presentations.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.  Current UI students should register directly on MyUI.  Students who are not admitted to the UI click here to proceed. Contact 319-335-2575 or dce-registration@uiowa.edu for assistance.",

    "description": "This course will emphasize the five key elements of a winning campaign: the candidate, organization, adequate finances, a believable contrast with the opponent and a base of support on which to build.  Special attention will be paid to using campaign information systems in developing the strategy, message, and plan for the campaign as well as managing it to a successful conclusion.\nStudents are required to attend all class sessions for this week-long course. \nAbout the Instructor:\nJoe Gaylord ranks among the nation’s most experienced political consultants.  His thirty years experience have given him a unique perspective and expertise in strategic message development, media, grass roots, party coalition building, and campaign organization.\nHe served the National Republican Congressional Committee for eight years between 1981 and 1989, including six years as its Executive Director.  In that role, he oversaw its political communications and management, including its national advertising campaigns, and in providing direct strategic assistance of hundreds of GOP Congressional campaigns.\nServing as the senior counselor to Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Speaker dubbed him the “irreplaceable man” for his work as principal architect for the House leadership in mapping out and leading the effort to execute a blueprint to elect a Republican Majority in the House in 1994.  For his achievement, his peers in the American Association of Political Consultants named him Co-Campaign Manager of the Year.\nHe led the successful effort for the House leadership to re-elect the Republican House majority in 1996 and 1998 – a feat not accomplished since the days of Herbert Hoover.\nMr. Gaylord was the person who developed the Campaign Management College for the Republican National Committee.  He supervised the program for the 1994-1998 cycles and the 2002 cycle.  He also founded the American Campaign Academy, a school offering professionals an eleven week training course in campaign management and fund raising.  He served as its Board Chairman for five years.\nMr. Gaylord began his career with the Republican State Central Committee in Iowa.  During his seven years with the committee, he worked his way through the ranks from field representative to Executive Director.  In 1975, he joined the Republican National Committee.  He served with the RNC for six years through the chairmanship of Mary Louise Smith and Bill Brock.  In 1977, he became the Eastern Director of the Local Elections Campaign Division.  He served as National Director of that division until 1981.  During this period, Republicans won a net gain of nearly 600 state legislative seats and doubled the number of legislative chambers in which Republicans gained a majority.\nMr. Gaylord also served on the Board of Directors of GOPAC, the preeminent GOP organization for the generation of ideas and training of the GOP farm team from 1989 to 1999.\nHe is the author of two books to guide GOP candidates and incumbents, Flying Upside Down and Flying Right-Side Up, as well as numerous audio training tapes for candidates and campaign professionals.\nHe has worked with the International Republican Institute, and has lectured not only across the United States but around the world in Brazil, Chile, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Croatia, and Hong Kong.\nHe is Adjunct Professor of Political Science and Advisory Board Member for the Political Science Department at the University of Iowa.  He has been a Fellow of the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University and a Fellow at the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at The University of Kansas.",

    "description": "Art and Visual Culture is an introductory course designed for students who have had no previous art history courses. Students meet for lectures by Professor Kinsey on Tuesdays and Thursdays and then in smaller group sections with Art History Graduate Student Teaching Assistants. The course fulfills the UI General Education Requirements for fine arts or humanities. We will work towards facility with analysis of visual objects, familiarity with media and techniques that artists have used over time, understanding different approaches to subject matter and aesthetic issues, and an acquaintance with the dominant historical periods and movements from ancient times to the present. Writing and speaking about art will be emphasized as well in section meetings. Focusing mainly on art of the western world, this course is not a survey, but will provide a strong orientation to the visual aspects of the humanities, good background for additional art history courses, and an introduction to the visual arts for personal enrichment. Requirements include regular attendance, a series of quizzes, and two to three short (3-5 page) papers, two of which require only looking, thinking, and writing, rather than research.",

Artists include Rembrandt, Gentileschi, Rubens, David, Vigée-Lebrun, Goya, Turner, Delacroix, Morisot, Monet and the Impressionists, Van Gogh, Picasso and Matisse, among many others.\n \nThere are two lectures each week and a discussion section.

The class surveys the history of western art, from pre-historic cave paintings through the age of Gothic cathedrals, touching along the way on the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the early medieval world. In richly illustrated lectures and weekly discussion sections, students will be invited to consider big questions such as: What do we really mean by “art”? What roles has art played in pre-modern societies? How can study of ancient and medieval art contribute valuable perspectives on modern art and culture? Or, more specifically, why was the Old Capitol in Iowa City designed to look somewhat like a Greek temple? By the end of the course, students will have gained familiarity with the broad outlines of western artistic tradition through the late Middle Ages, and they will also have developed valuable skills in decoding and writing about visual imagery, which can be useful in analyzing everything from political advertisements to website design.",

Creativity is part of what makes us human, and understanding the creative process is relevant to all of us. In this course, we will examine questions about big ideas, such as: What is creativity and how can we be more creative? What can we learn from closely examining our own and others’ creative work? What is the role of creativity across the human lifespan? How can creative work be a part of healthy adult life and healthy aging? We will especially consider the lives and work of artists. Because artists intensively imagine things that don’t yet exist, understanding artist’s experiences will enhance innovation and imagination. Students in the arts, liberal arts, sciences, and social sciences can apply the experience gained from studying the outcomes of creativity and working with established artists to other academic disciplines.\nStudents will engage in activities and projects as opposed to lectures and exams. Taught in an active-learning TILE classroom, Creativity for a Lifetime brings together the knowledge, skills, and life experiences of students and faculty members interested in an array of disciplines, including art and art history, anthropology, education, rhetoric, social work, aging studies, and the health sciences. To better appreciate the elements of successful aging, the richness of life-long learning, and an appreciation of the role of creative endeavor throughout a lifespan, students will meet Iowa artists and collect their oral histories.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

The course will teach students how to create high quality black and white and color photographic files using digital techniques. Students will also learn to use computer technology, using CC Bridge, PhotoShop, and Camera Raw for maximum control of tonality, content and visual impact. This course will also discuss the history of photography as it has informed political and social issues from its inception in 1834 to the present. We will look closely at contemporary image making, from the ubiquitous “selfie” to the impact of Flicker and Facebook and Instagram in the online world. Recent state of the art photography by contemporary artists will be examined both as an art form and as a cultural product. Students must have access to a digital SLR camera with on-camera flash, a tripod, and Photoshop CS6 or Photoshop CC.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

Through parallel, in-depth investigations students will research historical sites, physical and/or virtual space, cartography and the language of objects. The class will meet on M-W combining studio days and individual studio visits. Field trips are part of this class. \n \nStudents will work with sculptor, Eric Adjetey Anang, to create fantasy coffins.  These coffins are a traditional art unique to the Ga people of southern Ghana. The coffins are functional, customized, sculpted and painted to be figures or objects that represent the deceased. Students will also explore art as process and experience and will design work specific to a location and if removed from that location the work loses all or a substantial part of its meaning.",

But a science fiction canon that ignores half its authors and readers—and frequently the most provocative, political, boundary-pushing half—plays into the worst stereotypes of the genre and tells only a fraction of its own story. This seminar traces the history of twentieth century American science fiction by following the women. We will read a series of short stories and essays that take up questions of sex, gender, sexuality, and embodiment—and that turn their gaze inward to consider the place of these concerns within science fiction as a field. Our objective will be to develop a richer and more complete understanding of this literary genre—one that not only makes room for but is structured around participants of all genders. Readings will include work by Merril, Heinlein, Delaney, Zoline, Le Guin, Russ, Tiptree, Butler, Atwood, and Fowler. Writing assignments will be a series of informal two-page responses. There will be some mini-lectures and film excerpts, but this course will be mostly discussion-based.",

    "description": "Neurodegenerative diseases and injury to the eye and brain, such as traumatic brain injury or glaucoma, typically lead to progressive deterioration of neurons. These diseases can result from genetic susceptibility, a medical condition, toxins, chemicals, viruses or from unknown causes. Degenerative nerve disease can be serious and/or life threatening and adversely impact the quality of life for affected individuals. These diseases may affect multiple bodily functions in addition to the eye and brain. Importantly, most neurodegenerative diseases have no cure. The treatments designed for these diseases may help to improve symptoms, but do not offer lasting relief from the disease.\nIn this course we will explore how neurodegenerative diseases affect the human body, the societal and psychological impact of the disease on affected individuals, current treatments for these diseases and emerging research into new therapies for these diseases.\nThe goal of this course is for students to broadly understand how neurodegenerative diseases cause impairment of bodily functions and to offer insight on how this affects patients and their families. This course will be a highly interactive course with discussion and student group presentations. Assessment and grading for the course will be based on class participation and short writing assignments.",

    "description": "In the last two decades, it seems like everything has been queered.  We have queer theory/queer politics, queer citizenship, queer performativity, genderqueer, the New Queer cinema, the new New Queer cinema, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Queer as Folk—and these are only some of the examples that explicitly use queer as a signifier. It should be clear that the meaning of “queer” is up for grabs as all of these examples employ related but different connotations of the term. The reclamation of “queer” has been a welcome development in some circles, while in others “queer” may connote, among other things, racism, sexism, and/or politically paralyzing theory. Each of these positions is informed by different interpretations of the meaning of “queer,” interpretations that conflict over the importance of one’s identity, actions, and sexuality. We will enter these debates from the perspective of engaged intellectuals, concerned with improving cultural modes of democratic practice. These practices include activities such as the production and consumption of various kinds of media and legal rhetorics, the use of public and private spaces, and the possibilities of coalitional politics. As engaged intellectuals we will allow political practices and academic theorizing to inform one another as each one of us develop our stance on the utility of rhetorics of queer identities, theories, and politics.",

In this class, we'll look closely at what that means: How do skilled authors take true stories and events, and make them into works of art that captivate their readers? The stakes in creative nonfiction are always high, and we'll push ourselves to be brave in the face of dangerous writing through weekly, guided essays and an end-of-semester project tying them together. Along the way, we'll take up the works of Joan Didion, George Orwell, E.B. White, and other essayists to guide us.\nInstructor: Robert Peck learned storytelling from his grandfather, a World War II veteran-journalist and European bookmaker.

In this course, we will practice of new ways of seeing and describing the world. Careful description—forestalling the moment of explanation—can challenge our assumptions and lead to unexpected insights. Describing keeps us faithful to the world’s wonder and strangeness; it can preserve its capacity to shock. We will ask: What makes a description transformative? How might narrative emerge from description? And, most importantly, how is the self revealed through the act of description--that is, how is the seer revealed in what they see? We will learn from writers who, through a heightened quality of attention, show us the world in a new way--writers like Claudia Rankine, Sei Shonagon, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, Francis Ponge, Virginia Woolf, Jamaica Kincaid, William Maxwell, and David Foster Wallace. With an emphasis on enhancing creative thinking in our everyday lives, we will complete many in-class creative exercises, and through the process of reading, workshopping, and revising, explore the myriad forms and possibilities nonfiction can offer.\nInstructor: Anya Ventura is a writer whose work has appeared in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Artforum, Temporary Art Review, and The Rumpus, among others.Required Texts:Citizen: An American Lyric, Claudia Rankine, ISBN-10:1555976905\nSo Long, See You Tomorrow, William Maxwell, ISBN-10:0679767207",

    "description": "Many writers look inward to solve problems of existence: to make sense of the senseless, to disentangle lies or contradictions, and to heal invisible wounds. Some write to seize the fleeting moment, to declare beauty, and to render private experience more significant. There are a few for whom personal writing is a matter of survival, and only through journeys of reflection can such individuals transcend their limitations and reinvent the world that shapes them. In this course, we will read works by Nick Flynn, Mary Karr, Lucy Grealy, Kathryn Harrison, and others whose vitality seems to depend on introspection. We will examine the kinds of surrender and sacrifice that such writers undergo in pursuit of universal truths, resolution, and transformation. In addition to learning how to map and navigate narratives as personal quests, students will workshop and revise multiple autobiographical works for a portfolio that demonstrates risk, growth, and discovery.\nInstructor: Dina Peone is an award-winning poet, essayist, and diarist from the Hudson Valley who, before moving to Iowa, earned a BA at Sarah Lawrence College and facilitated a semester-long workshop in creative writing with incarcerated women.

As part of our class discussion, we’ll cross-pollinate the written word with the filmed image as we study certain essays and watch the films they were turned into. We’ll also screen nearly a dozen stand-alone examples of this wild, endlessly flexible genre and engage in rigorous discussion about just what is an essay film—what conventions it can ignore, what mischief it can get up to, what it can accomplish that a standard documentary cannot. Finally, we’ll set out to craft our very own films using that most ubiquitous of filmic equipment: the camera phone.\nNo previous film experience is necessary! Nor do you need a mastery of expensive equipment or software; this course will either fill in those gaps or skirt them entirely. We’ll keep to a low-tech aesthetic to reflect the often-rebellious nature of the essay as we film, edit, and workshop our projects, using Tangerine (a feature film shot entirely on an iPhone 5s) as our guiding star.\nInstructor: Taney Kurth has written about antique consignment stores, competitive video games, open-heart surgery, the dying process, and deafness.

A uniquely rewarding type of nonfiction writing, immersion journalism takes grit, empathy, and the time necessary to research deeply important stories. In this class, you will embed within an Iowa City institution or organization in order to practice the art of keen observation and quality note-taking, ultimately emerging with a riveting piece of immersion journalism. Meanwhile, we will read from such diverse writers as Nellie Bly (who went undercover in a mental institution), Richard Preston (who wrote from the frontlines of an infectious disease), Adrian Nicole LeBlanc (who lived with a family for eleven years), Ted Conover, David Foster Wallace, Barbara Ehrenreich, Joe Sacco, and Truman Capote.

    "description": "You’ve written it—now how do you publish it? This course will investigate the world of publishing, focusing specifically on literary journals, small presses, and our relationship to these outlets as readers, writers, and eventual publishers ourselves. We’ll examine a diverse selection of recently published work, from magazines like Oxford American to The Diagram to The Paris Review, and we’ll talk to the editors who facilitated that work’s exposure, asking them what makes an attractive submission, what their editorial process looks like, how they survive financially, and more. In addition to learning the field’s history and trajectory, we will discuss—and argue, constructively—about the role of publishing today, while confronting the dilemma of what to publish, how to acquire it, and how to get it in the hands of an audience. Most of all, we will strive to become better advocates for our own essays, short stories, and poems, leaving the course able to sharply and smartly articulate our artistic sensibilities to potential readers and editors. This course will include hands-on editorial exercises involving pitching, soliciting, and managing a publication, and will conclude with the production of a literary journal composed of student work.\nInstructor: Micah Fields is from Houston, Texas. He has written and published work about Pizza Hut, collage art, hurricanes, and the war in Afghanistan.

    "description": "The crafted verbal texture of prose style will guide discussion as both a topic and a goal. This is a course in reading for writing. With illustrations drawn from fiction and nonfiction alike, you will be studying master sentences from great writers in order to master sentences of your own, concentrating on diction and syntax, words and their wording, in a mix of intensive reading and applied writing. Like the word itself slipping from adjective to predicate, modifier to subordinate verb, in that last sentence (lesson # 1 right there), how can the very idea of “mastery” shift over from an attribute recognized to a force activated in your own prose? Here is a course in literature as rhetorical example rather than as interpretive challenge. We will be thinking not so much about the style of geniuses as about the genius of style—and how to plug into its energies, not just by aspiration but by practiced strategies of sentence building from week to week.",

    "description": "In this class, we will be examining the idea of portraiture, cataloging the various ways that writers of creative nonfiction have turned to literature to try and work through questions of what it means to see, truly see, the whole of a person, in all their complexities. Does the answer lie in photographic precision? Or is it through impressionistic strokes that encourage a more emotional, psychological interpretation? In what way do we truly find access another person? We will explore the various ways writers have interpreted the idea of the literary self-portrait, from work that seems invite the reader’s direct gaze, to sketches of others that actually end up revealing far more about the writer herself. As we read such writers as Thomas De Quincey, Natalie Diaz, Plutarch, Jo Ann Beard, Montaigne, Alison Bechdel, Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras, Joseph Mitchell, James Baldwin, and Zora Neale Hurston, we will be looking to their various interpretations of portraiture to help guide our own writing. And then we will take all this examining and questioning one step further, by doing intensive reflection on our own decisions as writers through the workshop process.",

    "description": "This course explores the idea that to learn to teach writing best, we must write and read; these acts cannot be disconnected. Students read and discuss accounts by professional writers, student writers, teachers of writing, and writing researchers. The discipline of composition studies, as well as reflections by writers on writing, is rich with interesting documentation, important theory, and vigorous dialogue. Students write for an audience to read and respond, in a broad variety of genres including the personal essay, the poem, short fiction, short nonfiction, the letter, the one-pager, and an experimental blur of genres. Writing is one tool for working out thinking. It is a link between inner speech and a frame for talk, a link between writer/speakers and reader/listeners. It is a writing teacher's responsibility to create an environment that ensures a diet of varied writing and broad reading, a community of rich, specific responders, and lots of opportunities for revising and careful editing. Along with the development of the individual writer-reader, the \"social construction of knowledge\" is an important concept in a writing class, and students experience it in this course. There are no actual stages, there is no specific process, but we can describe and theorize about prewriting techniques, revision strategies, conferencing models, inventories of grammatical conventions and mechanics, and publishing opportunities. Describing writing allows us to freeze the action to discover conditions under which writing takes place, and what the differences are in every writer's approach. To teach writing, you need to see that the act of writing is different with each piece you write, that you contribute to the next piece you write with each piece you read.\nEnglish majors may apply this course to the following area and/or period requirement.

And how do we teach that?” Another question: you like teaching, you like the idea of being able to get a job, part-time or full-time, teaching writing to college students? In this course, we’ll work with interesting academic resources: articles, books, journals, websites, organizations, conferences, special interest groups. You’ll build an appropriate CV, dossier, cover letter, teaching portfolio, keep track of job announcements, and learn how to write convincing applications. We’ll explore the ever-painful questions about how to assess, evaluate, and grade student writing, what alternatives and complements to grading we have as writing teachers. We’ll investigate writing and publishing writing about teaching. Together, we’ll determine dates, times, and casts of characters for special readings, master classes, Writers Gone Public, pedagogy partners for mutual observations, and class visits.\nBooks will be at Prairie Lights.",

    "description": "We’ve all been told how important it is to “find your voice” as a writer. This has been especially true in the world of literary nonfiction where voice is shorthand for aesthetic or rhetorical artistry. Yet written texts don’t really have voices. They may be teeming with stylistic codes, but those are quiet things. In the silence of the printed word, voice is at best a trope for the formal construction of a work across different stylistic registers. Not so in the case of radio where voice means vocalization, where words sound off. When an essay learns how to speak, when it has a real “voice,” what can it say? In this workshop, we’ll explore voice quite literally as an acoustic event by experimenting with three modes of radiophonic nonfiction—narrative, essayistic, and documentary (students will complete projects in two out of three of these genres). Along with a good deal of revising, we will do close readings and critiques of student work, in both written and radiophonic form, as well as read and listen to selected radio essayists and sound artists. Each student’s written and studio work will receive at least two formal workshops over the course of the semester. The goal of this class is to help you discover, develop, and strengthen your capacities as a writer of artful nonfiction that is as compelling to the ear as to the eye. You’ll use the English Department’s media studio for sound work, learning how to produce voiceovers, record interviews, capture sounds and music, and edit these things with spoken texts.",

    "description": "Many writers are initially taught that becoming a critic demands they place themselves at an analytical and rhetorical remove from their objects of study – or, at least, to adopt a prose style that enables them to convincingly fake such distance. “Performative writing,” as Della Pollock influentially described it in 1998, is not solely “a matter of formal style,” but rather a “discursive practice” that is “an important, dangerous, and difficult intervention into routine representations of social/performative life.” Emerging in the wake of poststructuralist theories, especially as taken up in the fields of anthropology, performance studies, and feminist, gender, and queer studies, performative criticism seeks not to describe or to analyze but rather to do. The term has been defined variably, but it is not merely a synonym for “creative essay.” In this course, we will read and respond to a selection of the diverse theories and practices that can be aligned under the flickering sign of this growing anti-genre. The syllabus may include writing by Pollock, Kathy Acker, Gloria Anzaldúa, Antonin Artaud, J.L. Austin, Roland Barthes, Barbara Browning, Judith Butler, Hélène Cixous, Jacques Derrida, Tim Etchells, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Matthew Goulish, Adrian Heathfield, bell hooks, Wayne Koestenbaum, Fred Moten, José Esteban Muñoz, Peggy Phelan, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Michael Taussig, among others.

    "description": "Was Andy Warhol right when he clamed in 1968 that \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes?\" What does it mean that certain celebrities are now famous for being famous? And why do we spend so much time and energy commenting on these issues? This class provides students with an opportunity to study the meaning of celebrity in contemporary America. We will examine a wide range of artistic (Warhol's “screen tests”), literary (Bright Lights, Big City, Reality Hunger: A Manifesto), cinematic (Natural Born Killers, Almost Famous), televisual (Keeping up with the Kardashians), musical (Kanye West), digital (the Youtube star phenomenon), political (Clinton, Obama, Trump) and scholarly (The Frenzy of Renown) engagements with these challenging topics. We will also analyze the way in which the old and new media have generated provocative opportunities for the creation and analysis of celebrity. Students will be expected to speak in class, keep a journal, and write one short essay.",

    "description": "We tend to think of intimacy as an essentially romantic disposition. Given that intimacy typically signals close proximity— both emotionally and physically— this is unsurprising. Such proximity also suggests a kind of sharing, of knowledge in particular, which in turn breeds intimate relations. In this course, we will explore the various ways in which intimacy functions as a kind of knowledge about peoples and bodies in relation to one another. Broad questions we will investigate include: How and when do we mark an experience as intimate? Who gets to have certain kinds of intimate experiences, but not others? Where is intimacy permissible and where is it not? What other modes of being in relation can be claimed as intimate? Can fear, shame, and anxiety be counted as felt states of intimacy? On a smaller scale, this will include investigating the reading experience itself as one that generates a kind of intimate knowledge: about ourselves and potentially about other people, too. In turn, we will work through the process of writing as a kind of intimate exchange between ourselves as writers and the texts we read. Speaking in a practical sense, one of main goals will be to improve our reading and writing skills by thinking critically about what writers put on a page and the effects of those choices. \n \nRequired Texts, available at Prairie Lights:\nThe Handmaid’s Tale 978-0385490818\nDon’t Let Me Be Lonely 978-1555974077  Winesburg, Ohio 978-0140186550",

    "description": "Are human beings capable of perceiving the world the way it really is, or are we under the influence of some kind of delusion? And if we are under the influence of some kind of delusion, who—or what—sustains it? God? Government? Language? Technology? Our own minds? Fake news?  Scientists, philosophers, and artists in western culture have been asking these questions for millennia—from Plato’s allegory of the cave to Descartes’s argument from doubt, Kant’s transcendental idealism, Marx’s formulation of ideology, Freud’s postulation of the unconscious, and the host of postmodern thinkers who question the existence of objective truth.  As such, the theme of this course could be called “the politics of perception.” Reading across a range of genres and mediums—including poetry, short stories, novels, and film—we will consider the ways in which texts engage how we perceive. We will consider how the worlds of, and in, fiction intersect with our own, and what factors influence the meaning we make of, and from, them. We will pay special attention to texts that attempt to challenge or even disrupt our everyday perceptions, inviting us to imagine a different kind of world.\n \nWhile our theme will be the politics of perception, this is a general education course designed to introduce students to literary analysis, effective argumentation, and college-level writing. This class will also afford students the opportunity to sharpen a widely-applicable toolkit, which includes the ability to think critically and communicate well-developed ideas in all walks of life.\n \nCourse requirements include essays, various informal writing assignments, exams, and a final group presentation.\n \nRequired texts (available at the University Bookstore):  Shelley, Mary.

In this course, we will explore these and many other themes by virtually walking the streets of London, getting to know the city as a character in its own right in the stories we will read. We will explore why London has such a prominent role in English literature, offering our own interpretations of the city, and generating ideas of what urban spaces can tell us about ourselves as individuals and as a society: what we fear, what we desire, what we strive for, and what we suppress. Since London is one of the most written-about cities in literature, it is the perfect case-study for developing our interpretative and analytical skills, offering us the chance to look at the city from multiple perspectives.\nCourse Texts, from Prairie Lights:\nCharles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities.

    "description": "We open it at the spine, examine its body, and then move to the appendix. Thankfully, we are not in surgery; we are reading. Nevertheless, texts come to us, often, in fragments, “and all parts / spine / into spine,” as Lorine Niedecker suggests in “Traces of Living Things.”\nAs a body and addressing the body, literatures in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have grappled with extraordinary shifts in the way we understand and experience bodies—both our own and the “othered” body. Historically, World War I churned up an undercurrent of fragmentation, where the horrors of warfare filtered back into societal consciousness. Writers and poets addressed the broken body not only in subject but also in literary technique. From there, the body faced further fragmentation in an era filled with issues related to the rights, representations, and reconceptualization of the body. Writers and poets continued to challenge the boundaries, conventions, and rules that governed and affected different bodies, utilizing the book and its body as a means for experimentation.\nThis course will explore the body of text and the body in text, examining the ways in which writers have historically engaged with material and physical representation, as well as how they have challenged notions of agency, performance, unity, and autonomy. Through historical relationships, avant-garde poetics, and theoretical concepts like assemblage, we will consider the body as material, technique, and subject. Ultimately, we will consider how literature has imagined or projected the body as a response to social or political conditions.  \n Required Texts, at Prairie Lights Bookstore:\n\nMargaret Atwood, The Handmaid’s Tale [Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN 978-0385490818] $15.95\nClaudia Rankine, Don’t Let Me Be Lonely [Graywolf Press, ISBN 978-1-55597-407-7] $16\nAnne Carson, Antigonick [New Directions, ISBN 9780811222938] $11.95",

Google it. \nIt’s impossible to read all the books, but it is possible to taste a few popular genres. Like the sampler platter appetizer at any good restaurant, this class has something for everyone: fantasy, dystopia, historical fiction, mystery, and non-fiction memoir. We’ll read from multiple formal genres (drama, novels, short stories, poems, essays) across these thematic genres. We’ll dip our texts in a variety of analytical sauces—personal response, comparative analysis, historical context, generic tropes—in the service of closely reading the text. We’ll write about our reactions to the readings often and discuss them in class even more. We’ll play with our food, spill it on our shirts, and sometimes spit it into our napkins. At the end of the semester, you will take your expanded palate on a journey to find the genre with which you most connect through reviewing a book of your own choice.\nVigilant attendance and active presence in the class are a must, or you’ll miss the eleven pop quizzes interspersed throughout the semester.

    "description": "Literature has a surprising history of using the impossible or imagined to help its readers understand those concerns most pressing in the real world. Whether it is science fiction imagining inhumane technological futures, fantasy which challenges reductive views of the world, or horror as a means to explore psychological trauma, these genres imagine alternatives to realism as a means to find and articulate meaning. As a class we will explore how these expressions emerge in graphic novels, film, poetry, short stories and novels. Over the course of the class we will produce two mini-essays which will each be expanded into more substantial 5-6 page papers. In lieu of a final we will have semi-regular quizzes.",

Through a host of mediums including the graphic novel, memoir, poetry, literary nonfiction, visual art, and more, we will ask how is otherness conveyed in literature? What can writing do to erase (or reinforce) divides between communities? How can writing both replicate and transcend social constructions we see in the world around us? What do you bring, as a reader, to these conversations?

    "description": "\"We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” This is the very first line of the very last reading of our semester, and it also functions as the thesis statement for the course. You may ask, “Why would you drop this massive spoiler just as we’re setting out? Now we all know how it ends.” But, as with any good thesis statement, this one means little unless it can be prodded, bent, stretched, and otherwise explored through a multitude of lenses. Thus, while we may know why, ultimately, we tell stories, we still have much to ask ourselves: Who is telling these stories? What choices are they making in the telling? What happens when parts of a story are silenced, or fragmented, or twisted, or lost? What do stories recover? Do stories merely help us survive, or can they change the course of our lives, of others’ lives? For better? For worse? Throughout the semester we will dig deeper into the art of narrative to find the stories that change us.\nCoursework will involve daily participation in class discussions, reading quizzes, short responses, two papers, and a short media project",

    "description": "The United States prides itself on being a free and open society, a “beacon of freedom for all the peoples of the Earth” to quote president Ronald Reagan. In order to be a such a society, it is imperative to study those things which threaten such ideals and the work that is required in order to maintain them. Tyranny and oppression can vary in scope from the personal to the whole of society and all levels in between. The shining beacon casts many shadows, and in those shadows tyranny is nurtured and oppression thrives. Whatever the scope of these ills, it is necessary to learn to recognize them in order to combat them. And in order to combat them, it is important to understand the language of resistance.\nTo better understand systems of oppression and tyranny, and how resistance operates within and around them, we will engage with several literary works exploring several types of oppression, tyranny, and resistance. One of our goals is to read these texts with an aim at understanding how they frame these subjects, their stances, and the language they employ. We will read two novels in this class: Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and Octavia Butler’s Kindred which explore, among other things, racial and gender oppression. We will also read Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir Fun Home, about coming to terms with her father’s life in the closet and the formation of her own lesbian identity, and Claudia Rankine’s Citizen, which reflects on present issues surrounding the discourses of race in America.\nWe will also read other texts provided through ICON including poetry by Natasha Trethewey, short stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ursela K. LeGuin, Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun, and other texts. This course will feature a midterm and two papers, as well as other assignments.\n \nMargaret Atwood, The Handmaid’s Tale (1985, Doubleday/ISBN 978-0385490818) - $15.95\nOctavia Butler, Kindred (1979, Beacon/ISBN 978-0807083697) - $16.00\nClaudia Rankine, Citizen: An American Lyric (2014, Graywolf/ISBN 978-1555976903) - $20\nAlison Bechdel, Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic (2004, Mariner/ISBN 978-0618871711) - $15.99",

Over the course of the semester, we will question the plurality of apocalypses: their multiple locations, velocities, temporalities, and splatter radiuses. We will read accounts of life after modern apocalypses – slavery and Jim Crow, WWII and the Holocaust, colonialism and environmental collapse, 9/11 and the War on Terror – and ask how life can continue during the end times. Our texts will cover the range of forms that apocalypse takes, from personal to global, momentary to infinite. As a central practice, we will attend to feminist, queer, and critical race studies. And by the close of our class we will hopefully come to better understand the lasting appeal of the end—the end of history, suffering, and knowledge. \nTexts\nSong of Solomon, by Toni Morrison\nEndgame, by Samuel Beckett\nMy Atonia, by Willa Cather \nDon't Let Me Be Lonely, by Claudia Rankine\n \nBookstore\nPrairie Lights",

The texts, too, come from a specific moment in history, which, in addition to the factors above, influenced the author. We (readers and writers) also belong to several different communities, which influences the way we read texts and the way writers produce texts. In this class, we will explore how these social, cultural, and historical dynamics not only influence the reading and writing of texts, but also how they shape ideas of community. By the end of the class, we hope to be stronger, more confident readers who have developed our interpretive skills and our ability to communicate ideas about texts both verbally and in more formal arguments. Moreover, we hope to establish habits that will make us life-long readers who can respond intelligently and critically to texts of all kinds. To that end, we will be reading short stories, poems, nonfiction, novels, and one short play. Students should be prepared to engage texts rigorously and to come to class ready to participate actively in classroom discussion.\nCourse requirements include several short reading responses, one formal essay, and three quizzes.",

This semester, we will be working with characters whose worlds have irrevocably shifted, due to apocalyptic forces, the zombie invasion, hyper-commercialized social networking, magical happenings and more. Our readings will come from multiple literary genres, including short stories, plays, poems, and three novels: Gary Shteyngart’s Super Sad True Love Story, Colson Whitehead’s Zone One, and Don DeLillo’s White Noise. As we read, we will consider how characters’ identities shift in response to trauma and the pressures of heroism, how they work to interpret the new worlds they inhabit, and what these new worlds teach us about our own.\nIn this course, we will focus on the act of interpretation, using and refining our skills of reading, speaking, and writing to respond critically and sensitively to literary texts. We will consider a web of relations between the text, ourselves as readers, and the historical, social, political, and cultural worlds in which both texts and readers reside.

The decision was seen by many as the pinnacle of a decades-long struggle for LGBT rights, beginning with the Stonewall riots in 1969. But as the recent shooting at a gay bar in Orlando has indicated, the progression of what many would call equal rights for LGBT people in the United States has not exactly been linear. In this course, we will look at a range of texts that depict the LGBT experience in the United States, and we’ll also consider how queer-identified writers explore queerness in their texts. Broadly speaking, this class will ask you to engage in different ways of reading, including the individual reader’s experience of the text, the features of the text itself, and the text’s place in larger historical, social, political, and cultural contexts.

The class persistently investigates an apparent contradiction: why and how have acts and desires typically valued as highly personal and private (our \"sex lives\") been consistently made available to a mass public through popular, commercial media in modern America? Emphasizing the intertwined fascination with heterosexuality and homosexuality in mass media since the publication of the infamous Kinsey Reports just after WWII, this class considers popular responses to and representations of (among other events): the contradictory sexual discourses of the Cold War era, the “sexual revolution” and the rise of the women’s liberation movement, gay liberation and “queer” activism, and recent manifestations of “post-feminist” ideologies.  Readings for the course include a wide range of primary materials in various genres (fiction, drama, memoir, journalism, etc.) as well as retrospective historical and cultural studies. Students are required to attend two weekly (heavily illustrated) lectures by the course instructor and one weekly discussion section led by a teaching assistant.

    "description": "“Poetry is a break for freedom. In a sense all poems are good; all poems are an emblem of courage and the attempt to say the unsayable; but only a few are able to speak to something universal yet personal and distinct at the same time; to create a door through which others can walk into what previously seemed unobtainable realms, in the passage of a few short lines.” David Whyte\nThis course explores the power and the relevance of contemporary poetry. We ask, “What can a poem do in the world?” and the answers may surprise you. Working with Adrienne Rich’s Poetry and Commitment and Muriel Rukeyser’s The Life of Poetry, we examine such themes as the politics of difference, issues of gender, the historical self, the construction of race and the crisis of the environment. This course argues for the necessity of poetry in a complicated and fractured world. Course requirements will include a response journal, a series of take home quizzes and writing assignments and active and engaged participation in class discussions.",

We will study the evolution of the short story by reading examples of the genre by US and international authors from the last two centuries. We will explore how each story’s meaning is shaped by formal elements such as narration, plot, setting, characterization, dialogue, and style. The other primary goal of the course is to improve students’ critical writing. We will devote significant time to the process of writing successful critical essays, from brainstorming a topic to crafting a thesis statement to finding and citing critical sources to structuring an argument. Students should finish the course with a deeper understanding of the short story as a genre and improved abilities as critical writers.\nCoursework includes class participation, a reading journal with weekly postings, and two 5-page papers that go through a draft and revision process.\nRequired text:\nAnn Charters (ed.), The Story and Its Writer: An Introduction to Short Fiction, 9th edition (2015), ISBN 978-1457664618.",

    "description": "English majors may apply this course to the following area and/or period requirement. AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies. PERIOD: 20th/21st century literature for Fall 2017.\nIn a June 1959 Playboy article titled, “The Origins of the Beat Generation,” Jack Kerouac defined the modern Beats as wise men of few words, accompanied by women of fewer, writing: “The ‘cool’ (hipster) today is your bearded laconic sage, or schlerm, before a hardly touched beer in a beatnik dive, whose speech is low and unfriendly, whose girls say nothing and wear black.” Traditionally, critics have understood the position of women within the Beat community as peripheral, marking the literary “boy gang” of writers as a self-sustaining homosocial artistic community. For many years, with the notable exception of Diane di Prima, few women writers gained recognition as part of this literary movement, but in recent decades, memoirs by Beat women have spurred feminist recovery efforts to set the record straight. In this course, we will consider the place of these women writers within the Beat canon. We will first begin the semester by defining “Beat” together, focusing on work by foundational Beat writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. Next, we will turn to memoirs written by the women of the Beat Generation to consider the role of this genre within reconstructions of the Beat canon. Finally, we will examine fiction and poetry by these women writers, thinking about how our definitions of “Beat” change by broadening the term to encompass these works, as well as drawing connections between these writers’ aesthetics and stories.",

    "description": "Author of some of the best-loved poems in English, the Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850) became a true literary celebrity in his day, drawing both fawning adulation and some of the most vicious reviews imaginable. An unfaithful lover or a devoted husband and father, a radical revolutionary who became a Victorian conservative, a nature poet and early advocate for the environment, a bard of liberty or of the egotistical sublime: who was Wordsworth? The answers today are almost as varied as during his lifetime.\nIn this class we will read a range of Wordsworth’s poetry – from Lyrical Ballads (1798), the volume that inspired a generation of Romantic poets, to the great middle works and the poem he crafted and taunted readers with for the last 50 years of his life, the one that would tie his poetry together and reveal what they had kept shrouded, which he referred to as the “poem on the growth of my mind” and which was published after his death as The Prelude. We’ll also read portions of Juliet Barker’s award-winning biography of Wordsworth, contemporary reviews by his original readers, and controversial criticism from our own day. We’ll explore topics inspired by his poems and their context in his life and times – childhood, education, the French Revolution, Nature, religion, sexuality – all the while keeping in mind how those topics relate to the great story Wordsworth was working on behind the scenes: not heroic adventure or the fall from Eden, but the story The Prelude tells, which he considered of epic proportions, of the growth of a poet’s mind.\n \nReading List:\nWordsworth & Coleridge, Lyrical Ballads: 1798 and 1802, Oxford ISBN-13: 978-0199601967\nStephen Gill, ed.

Together, we will pursue the following lines of inquiry: How did the typewriter, phonograph, telephone, cinema, and radio remediate while also actively reshaping narrative, dramatic, and poetic form? How did these technologies reorganize the human sensorium and reconfigure human subjectivity? How can “British” modernist writers (broadly defined) be read as placing questions of technology and mediation in conversation with questions of gender, race, sexuality, and national identity? Students will be introduced to major works in media theory through excerpts made available on ICON. By considering aspects of the development of media technologies in relation to nineteenth- and twentieth-century works by Bram Stoker, Henry James, T. S.

    "description": "This course counts for the American Literature and Culture area requirement and for the Eighteenth- and/or Nineteenth-Century historical period.\nWe will focus on the work of the two major American poets of the nineteenth century, two of the most innovative and original poets ever to have written in the English language. Significantly, neither one was recognized as a major poet by the reading public during his or her own lifetime, though Whitman had a small but very devoted following. We will be coming at their poetry from a number of angles: biographical, cultural, aesthetic, historical. We will talk about ways that their poetry has come to influence several generations of American poets who followed them. We'll weave in and out of their work, discussing ways they responded to key nineteenth-century events (like the Civil War, developing technology, changing notions of science and religion, women's rights movements) and ways they challenged orthodox notions of writing poetry, of configuring gender, and of projecting America's future. We'll move back and forth between Whitman and Dickinson, looking for places where the work of one engages the work of the other and initiates a dialogue, a dialogue into which we will learn to insert ourselves.  We will also spend some time in the University Library’s Special Collections, where we have an extraordinary collection of first editions of Whitman’s work and early editions of Dickinson’s poems.\nThis will be a class in which discussion of the poetry is the central activity.  Students will memorize poems by both Dickinson and Whitman.  There will be quizzes on the biographical reading and a final examination in which students will write short essays comparing passages by both poets.  Students will write two essays on poems by Whitman and Dickinson, informed by our discussions and by the biographical readings.\nTexts (will be available at Prairie Lights Bookstore):\n\nEmily Dickinson, The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, edited by Thomas H.

Board black theater as the older extends the efforts of Lorraine Hansberry and the younger refines the strategies of Adrienne Kennedy.  Notwithstanding the differences in their creative works, these two playwrights ruled the last two decades of the 20th century with a thoroughness that is unprecedented in black theater history.  The Black Arts Movement may have propelled African American drama to widespread mainstream recognition; however, the string of Pulitzers and New York Drama Critics Circle Awards garnered by Wilson and Parks marks an unmatched degree of acclaim.  Gauging their impact on American society between the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, this course will study Wilson’s entire oeuvre and all of Parks’ dramatic work up until 2006.\nTexts\nSuzan-Lori Parks               \nRed Letter Plays\nThe America Play and Other Works\nTopdog/Underdog      \nVenus \n \nAugust Wilson\nJitney\nThree Plays    \nThe Piano Lesson\nTwo Trains Running\nSeven Guitars \nKing Hedley II\nGem of the Ocean\nRadio Golf",

    "description": "English majors may apply this course to the following area and/or period requirement. AREA: Transnational Literature and Postcolonial Studies. PERIOD: 20th/21st-Century Literature for Fall 2017.\nEver since the first media reports about a then still unknown disease began to circulate in the 1980s, HIV/AIDS has captured the imagination of writers and filmmakers. Not only has the illness redefined our understanding of gender and sexuality but—as a sexually transmitted disease—HIV/AIDS has also required us to examine cultural taboos and stigmas. Short stories and novels, feature films and documentaries can help us better comprehend the psychological, cultural, political and historical dimensions of a pandemic that continues to influence life in the twenty-first century.\nIn this class, we will focus on how African writers and directors have imaginatively engaged with a medical disease such as HIV/AIDS. To what extent do their stories expose and manipulate the stigma and prejudice associated with a sexually transmitted disease? What populations appear especially vulnerable to the disease and its social and economic consequences? How are local communities and governmental institutions involved in shaping responses to HIV/AIDS? How is a medical disease metaphorically appropriated to serve as a general symbol for the challenges of modern life? While this class emphasizes African stories about HIV/AIDS, we will also have an opportunity to reflect on the situation of HIV-positive populations in the United States and engage in a dialogue with people living with the disease.\nCourse requirements include regular attendance and active participation, a portfolio with responses to the assigned materials, one short paper and a final (critical or creative) project.

Claudia Rankine’s prize-winning book of poems, Citizen: An American Lyric, incorporates the poetics of documentary in multiple ways, from the print text to the series of videos that expand its content and audience. This course will examine the evolution of the documentary poem-- beginning with Muriel Rukeyser’s Book of the Dead—as we chart its specific intent to intervene upon history and to challenge the archival record. We will take up issues concerning the construction of a historical archive—how it functions, what it includes and what it excludes; the role of the cell phone camera and video as it contests and challenges more traditional versions of “the facts”; the relationship between poetry and history--with a particular interest in the power of poetry in the political arena of human rights and environmental survivance.\nThis course requires a commitment to close reading and an engaged discussion of the assigned texts.

    "description": "Just as the metaphor of the vampire rose from the historical and cultural conditions at the end of the nineteenth century and found resonance with many of the concerns of modernism throughout the twentieth, the metaphor of the zombie has become pervasive in the condition of postmodernity. In late twentieth and early twenty-first century fiction, films, and television, zombies are everywhere. Why? And what cultural functions does this pervasive metaphor serve? Indeed, is the zombie metaphor the perfect emblem for the salient concerns of postmodernism, combining as it does a critique of mass consumerism with fears of contagion and the breakdown of technocultural control, while providing an all-purpose scapegoat for a wide range of bigotries?\nThis course will be grounded in the reading of a range of print zombie narratives, including comics, novels, and ephemera. It will survey, sample, and occasionally screen zombie films and zombies on TV. It will consider the phenomenon of zombie video games and zombie-themed creations on the web.   \nPopular culture has always found ways to tap and reflect our secret fears and desires and then to increasingly colonize the public imaginary. So, what’s with all of these zombies?\nWork for the class will require short reading quizzes, a take-home midterm and a take-home final, a zombie book review, and a zombie-related class presentation.

    "description": "The political and social upheavals of the 1960s saw a surprising correspondence in the evolution of science fiction. America’s changing social consciousness was reflected in changes also in priority for the genre, such that looking forward meant not only new tech and science but emerging issues in racial justice, shifting possibilities for gender and sexual identities, even alternative experiences of reality. Sometimes these needs were met by so-called “soft” science fiction, based around social rather than empirical sciences, and sometimes this meant classic storylines given a new twist--alien encounters defined less by technological differences and more by psychological ones, the colonization of planets complicated less by resource concerns and more by ethical ones. In this class we will explore the post-60s standouts in science fiction, their impetuses and aesthetics, which helped distinguish the genre as forward thinking scientifically, socially, and artistically.\nReadings for this course include:Do Androids Dream 978-0345404473Slaughterhouse-V 978-0385333849Babel-17 978-0375706691The Female Man 978-0807062999The Lathe of Heaven 978-1416556961Lilith’s Brood 978-0446676106",

    "description": "Early modern Britain underwent rapid transformation from a small nation on the margin of Europe to a major colonial and cultural power. The appearance of revolutionary movements and secular political parties helped usher in the modern age. Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, Andrew Marvell, and John Dryden did not view these events from a distant gallery but actively involved themselves in politics, which penetrated into almost every corner of their world, including religion, literature, trade, and the role of women. By cutting across traditional literary periods the course opens new perspectives on four poetic careers as they took place over time and in history.   The goal of the course is to study four poetic careers as they unfold in specific political contexts: Spenser's celebration of Queen Elizabeth and her Irish policies; Jonson's status as a remnant of Elizabethan culture and publicist for the Stuart myth; Marvell's experimentation with various poetic styles, culminating in a densely allusive topical satire; and Dryden's attempts to shape public opinion and follow the migrations of power throughout his life. \nRequirements include two papers (50%); two quizzes (10% each); an in-class presentation (10%); attendance and participation (20%)\nRequired Texts \n\nR.O.

    "description": "This course might also be subtitled “The Bible for English Majors.” It approaches the Bible – the single most influential book on the Anglophone literary tradition – from the perspective of literary studies and a readership-based approach.  We will read widely in the Old and New Testaments as well as in the “Apocrypha” or deuterocanonical books, gaining familiarity with the biblical stories, figures, and phrases that color English and American literature, reading them with a literary sensitivity to plot and story, narrative and poetic structure, and metaphor. In other words, we will be reading the Bible as literature students, creative writers, and English majors. We will also read a range of texts by readers of the Bible from the Protestant, Roman Catholic, and patristic/Eastern Christian traditions, seeking to situate ourselves and our ways of reading the Bible among the variety of communities and interpretive sensibilities that have created the amazing imaginative richness surrounding this text over the last 2,000 years.  Approaching the Bible in this way will give students the ability to understand literary references to the Bible in a variety of meaningful ways and to ponder the significance of these stories, hymns, and poems in a secular or postsecular age. Students in this class will participate in lively class discussion, take notes on the readings and class sessions, write two short papers, visit Special Collections as part of an in-class project, and take two exams.   Reading List: The New Oxford Annotated Bible With Apocrypha (Oxford UP, ISBN-13: 9780195289558) St. Gregory of Nyssa, The Life of Moses (HarperCollins Spiritual Classics: ISBN-13: 978-0060754648) Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers, ed.

Our goal will be to achieve a nuanced understanding of this brilliant work in terms of Chaucer's literary and historical contexts. We will as well gain a sense of the contemporary critical debates that have shaped thinking on the poem over the long twentieth century. We will devote special attention to the category of “the human” as it emerges in Chaucer’s poetry and has been rethought over recent years by post-humanists. We will consider our own understandings of what it means to be a human, what it means to live the best human life and the role of literature in fostering such a life. We will consider how Chaucer, and medieval culture more broadly, portray humanity in relation to the non-human or less-than-human (e.g., monsters, Jews, Muslims, sodomites, women, children, animals, objects). I require close reading skills for all written assignments and for class discussion.",

    "description": "In 1601, a young law student in London copied down an anecdote in which a besotted playgoer arranged a rendezvous with the lead actor of Shakespeare’s company, the famous Richard Burbage, while he was still in costume as the most infamous villain in English history, King Richard III. As the story goes, Shakespeare heard of the rendezvous and usurped Burbage’s place with the punchline that “William the Conqueror was before Richard III.” This apocryphal story shows how strangely seductive the character of Richard III was, despite—or perhaps because of—his unrelenting evil, manifested in his disfigured body. As the recent global media frenzy over the rediscovery of the historical Richard’s skeleton (buried beneath a parking lot) shows, Richard remains an undeniably attractive figure for us. Indeed, audiences and readers continue to be drawn to the greatest villains in Shakespeare’s works.\nThis course will attempt to explain our ongoing fascination with Shakespeare’s villains by defining, re-defining, and upending our notions of what constitutes villainy. Characters like Richard III and Iago have long embodied and epitomized the Shakespearean villain—but the role of the villain, and even the term “villain,” were far more complicated. As such, we will focus not only on plays that feature famous villains, but on unexpected plays that will force us to reconsider what villainy meant for Shakespeare—and what it continues to mean for us.\nWe will spend much of our time reading the plays closely and critically, in order to become both familiar and comfortable with reading Shakespeare’s dynamic language. We will also learn about the professional theatre in which Shakespeare worked, and in which his plays were first staged, as well as the ways these plays have been performed, altered, and adapted over the subsequent centuries. We will encounter and use supplementary readings, online resources, and film versions that contextualize and galvanize the plays.\nCourse requirements will include active engagement in class discussion; a series of short exercises and writing assignments; and an individual critical or creative project. Readings will include Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Macbeth.",

No exams, but plenty of reason to draw conclusions about the writing that’s helping to define contemporary creative possibility.",

This extraordinary corpus constitutes one of the major accomplishments of American modernism, and we will treat it as such, comparing the Bard of Oxford’s aesthetic strategies to those of Eliot, Joyce, Woolf, Hemingway, Pound, Stein, and other literary giants. At the same time, we will tease from Faulkner’s works ample reason to employ an alternate methodology that examines popular culture, focuses on neglected geographies, and attends carefully to questions of race, class, gender, and sexuality.  Our critical orientation will be two-fold.  We will balance social and historical analysis of each novel with careful examination of its aesthetic qualities.",

    "description": "This course examines some of the pivotal works of late eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century African American literature. Throughout the semester, we will analyze the fictional representation of early African American life in the United States. We will also discuss: early versions of the African American novel; the black American’s transition from slavery to nominal freedom; male and female slave narratives; comparisons of the literary portrayals of black life in the North and the South; the controversies associated with racial passing; the role of “Negro” dialect in American and African American literature; literary and visual representations of lynching; and early cinematic representations of the black image. \nAmong the questions we will consider are: How did writers critique America’s discriminatory practices as well as intra-racial class and color prejudices? What were the influences of popular culture on the literature of the period? How did the Civil War and the continual threat of lynching affect black creative methods and philosophy? We will also look at the African American literary image created by other American writers such as Stephen Crane, Herman Melville, and Mark Twain, and the legal decisions and political compromises that affected the construction of African American personhood (such as the Dred Scott v. Sanford and the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decisions). There will be a significant focus on the writings of Charles Chesnutt, one of the most prolific early African American writers and an author who wrote in the 19th and early 20th centuries. \nReadings will be supplemented by films and audio recordings. Class requirements include quizzes, class participation, one paper, a mid-term, and a final exam.  \nReading list:\nPaul Laurence Dunbar, The Sport of the Gods• ISBN-10: 1614278261• ISBN-13: 978-1614278269Octavia Butler, Kindred• ISBN-10: 0807083690• ISBN-13: 978-0807083697John Hope Franklin, Three Negro Classics• ISBN-10: 0380015811• ISBN-13: 978-0380015818Herman Melville, Benito Cereno and Bartleby, ISBN:1619493799Charles Chesnutt, The Marrow of Tradition • ISBN-10: 1420937987• ISBN-13: 978-1420937985Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, Slave Narratives (Modern Library Edition), ASIN: B0043AWXVM",

PERIOD: 18th/19th century literature for Fall 2017.\nIf you grew up in the United States, you have probably heard, “American farmers feed the world.” What if we expand our notion of America to include Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean? After all, much of the produce lining supermarket shelves was grown in Chile and Mexico. The Americas have a rich agricultural legacy—for instance, giving the world potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and, of course, corn. Therefore, this course will approach the study of literature of the farm within a Hemispheric context, emphasizing how the movement of people (migration and immigration), information, and goods influences literary representations of farming and farm life. After reading works by Hawthorne, Whitman, Susanna Moodie, Jorge Isaacs, and Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda, among others, you should have a deeper understanding of how technology, labor, information, and the economy shape agriculture and how farming in turn drives change. This class will be useful for students interested in nineteenth-century American literature, nineteenth-century literature of the Americas, and the environmental humanities. \nStudents will be responsible for readings, keeping a reading journal, writing two short essays, and a final paper.\nBooklist:\n\nHector St. John de Crevecoeur, Letters from an American Farmer, Penguin, ISBN-13:978-0140390063\n\n\nBlack Hawk, Life of Black Hawk, Penguin, ISBN-13:978-0143105398\n\n\nGertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda y Artega, Sab and Autobiography, University of Texas Press, ISBN-13:978-0292704428\n\n\nMaria Ruiz de Barton, The Squatter and the Don, Modern Library, ISBN-13:978-0812972894\n\n\nHelena Maria Viramontes, Under the Feet of Jesus, Plume, ISBN-13:978-0452273870",

The literature represented includes current writings from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. Text materials (short fiction, poetry, excerpts from plays) are available on the course web site. The authors speak about their own writing and how their work relates to the literary scene in their countries. Literary issues such as translation, censorship, women's writing, and some background historical, political, or cultural information may be discussed in defining the specific literary context of a work, but the course focuses on the writing itself, its artistry and themes. During the remaining weeks of the semester, students read and discuss several contemporary literary works, both poetry and prose, with special attention to the themes brought alive by the visiting writers.\nFirst year students and sophomores with interest in world literature are welcome in the class, and should be able to complete the assignments successfully.\nStudents' participation includes preparing weekly questions for the visitors, keeping a journal, as well as two papers (for 3 s.h.).",

    "description": "This seminar will begin by posing the following simple question:  Are there any lessons that we, as students of literature, can or should derive from the perhaps surprising fact that, when asked to name books that had had the greatest influence in their lives, both Senator John McCain and President Barack Obama invoked Ernest Hemingway’s classic novel of the Spanish Civil War, For Whom the Bell Tolls? We will, of course, read the novel ourselves, and then we will use our resulting conversations (e.g., Are Democrats and Republicans not that different after all? Does great writing transcend ideology?) as a springboard for surveying subsequent classic (e.g., Catch-22, The Things They Carried, In Country) and contemporary (e.g., Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, Sand Queen, Sparta, War Porn) American writing about war. Our primary focus will be fiction, but we certainly won’t rule out making brief excursions into nonfiction and poetry to broaden our understanding of the forms that this writing takes. We will, of necessity, also devote time to the problem of gatekeeping—for example, what counts as a “war novel” in the first place and who gets to decide? \nAll students will be expected to come to class regularly and well prepared and to produce a 12- to 15-page analytic seminar paper that engages with one or more of the texts on the syllabus.  We will equip ourselves with the skills for executing such an assignment through a series of preliminary steps along the way: working in subgroups to identify important and/or recent scholarship on specific texts, summarizing that scholarship both orally and in writing for classmates, writing a short abstract about your chosen topic, and constructing an annotated bibliography. In the process we should gain some insight into the benefits and limitations of diverse critical approaches employed by the scholars whose analyses we read, be they feminist or formalist, Marxist or psychoanalytic, or something else entirely. Tentatively, furthermore, the class—or at least interested students—will be provided an opportunity to work with the staff and editor of the Iowa Review as they solicit and vet submissions for the next in a series of special issues the IR publishes biannually featuring winners of a writing contest for veterans. For this reason the class might be of interest to students interested in literary publishing as well as those interested in great writing about war.",

    "description": "Among the plays that flourished on the seventeenth-century stage were city comedy and the comedy of manners, two dramatic types with several features in common.  During a period of economic expansion and widespread social dislocation in the early seventeenth century, playwrights peopled city comedy with characters hot in pursuit of money, status, and love.  The comedy of manners, which came into its own after 1660, presents characters who navigate the complexities of gender, social mobility, conspicuous consumption, and marriage.  Both types exhibit a self-conscious cosmopolitanism that gets contrasted with the idiocy of rural life.  Either set in London or standing in its shadow, the plays identify themselves with the city, from their lowest haunts to the most fashionable resorts, and usually profess disdain for the provinces.  They adopt a sort of worldly localism, linking themselves to specific urban sites while satirizing city morals no less than country manners.  Over the semester we will discuss the emergence and popularity of these two genres, connections between London theater and the places it both celebrates and mocks, and transformations of  theatrical conventions towards the beginning of the eighteenth century.\nThe comedies we study are Jonson, Every Man in His Humour (1598); Middleton, A Trick to Catch the Old One (1605) and A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (1611); Dekker and Middleton, The Roaring Girl (1611); Molière, Les Précieuses ridicules (in translation as “Such Foolish Affected Ladies,” 1659); Wycherley, The Country Wife (1675); Etherege, The Man of Mode (1676); Vanbrugh, The Provok’d Wife (1697); and Congreve, The Way of the World (1700).\nClass meetings include active participation, presentations, and screening of a performance available on DVD and the Web (The Country Wife).  The final project is a critical essay that makes use of research, approximately fifteen to twenty pages in length, presented to the seminar in the form of a short talk and revised for final submission. Requirements also include a written exercise that uses research tools often consulted for the study of British drama.\nRequired texts are Ben Jonson, Every Man in His Humour, ed. Robert N.

    "description": "This class is designed to help you write your honors thesis. Together we will work on focusing your topic, developing a research strategy, building an annotated bibliography, and, most significantly, generating and evaluating substantial portions of the thesis itself. Because this is a workshop, we will emphasize collaborative thinking and productive comments. Class meetings will provide a place to test ideas, refine arguments, debate the results of research, even get a clue from others who want to help. Everyone is expected to come prepared to participate.\nOur conversations are designed to supplement ongoing work with your adviser, who will also want to respond to the material submitted for workshop discussion. Be sure to request such responses regularly over the course of the term. Those planning to graduate in December will complete the thesis and should naturally get an adviser’s feedback along the way. Those planning to graduate in May will produce a substantial portion of the thesis by the end of the semester and should have steady and specific advice on how well things are going. While advisers, second readers, and the Honors Committee will be the final judges, your thesis will also receive a grade for this workshop after a revised draft is submitted.\nWriting an honors thesis is the most challenging work you are likely to do as an undergraduate—and the most exhilarating. Sharing the process with a community of informed and supportive readers prompts a kind of synergy, collaborative ideas beyond what one or two people manage alone. Engaged discussion often produces writing that is unexpectedly passionate, insightful, and venturesome, especially as a thesis changes and matures. What makes this workshop genuinely valuable, certainly for those who are considering graduate studies, are the conversations that develop as the semester unfolds and the growing sense that your writing deserves to be read.",

    "description": "AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies and PERIOD: 18th/19th-Century Literature. \nFor UICB students, this course counts toward the Scholarly Inquiry area.\nThis course will explore notions of authorship, publishing, and reading in early America by way of the endlessly fascinating character of Benjamin Franklin. Before Franklin was a scientist and diplomat, he was a printer, publisher, bookseller, papermaker, and book trades entrepreneur. We’ll study various forms of early American print culture—pamphlets, broadsides, sermons, newspapers—that led to the forming of a new nation. The course will be equally interested in eighteenth-century culture, radiating out from Franklin into the history of ideas—Enlightenment reason, the cult of sensibility, evangelical revivalism, and the public sphere—and into the history of personhood—the man of feeling, the rational actor, the mechanical pragmatist, and the dispassionate citizen. Indeed, much of Franklin’s intellectual legacy emerges from his book trades life and we will examine ways that the work of the hand and the work of the mind are interwoven.\nThe course is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students and will be run as a seminar, with active participation required.  The reading load is heavy and demanding, as compared to lower-level literature classes. Interested graduate students are encouraged to speak with the professor. Short writings, research exercises, an oral presentation, and a longer essay—in total, all assignments will amount to 20-25 pages of writing.\nPossible assigned readings: Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography and the online papers of Franklin; The Christian History (colonial America’s first magazine); Henry Mackenzie, The Man of Feeling; Immanuel Kant, “What is Enlightenment?”; John Bunyan, Pilgrim’s Progress; Lawrence Sterne, A Sentimental Journey; Jonathan Edwards, “A Faithful Narrative”; selections from James N. Green and Peter Stallybrass, Benjamin Franklin: Writer and Printer,  Jurgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere , Robert Ferguson, The American Enlightenment, Michael Warner, The Letters of the Republic, Dror Wahrman, The Making of the Modern Self, Richard Sennett, The Craftsman, and Lewis Hyde, Common as Air: Revolution, Art, and Ownership.",

    "description": "Mystery/detective fiction is one of the most popular and enduring forms of literature, beginning as early as Edgar Allan Poe’s Dupin short stories. In this class you will sharpen your writing skills by experimenting with this genre. Within the category, there are several sub-genres, such as the “cozy,” the hard-boiled, true crime (nonfiction), thriller and suspense, and the police procedural. We will read some of the best examples of these sub-genres in order to understand how the author crafts a credible crime, a relatable detective or main character, and a realistic and motivated ending.\nDuring the first half of the semester, we will immerse ourselves in various forms of the mystery tale and each student will experiment with writing in at least two of these sub-genres. The second half of the semester will be spent developing a longer piece of fiction or nonfiction (such as true crime) and identifying appropriate places for publication. Students should be willing to write often, be willing to comment constructively on peers’ work, and be willing to take creative risks.",

This class will examine prose of all kinds: from familiar forms like the personal essay and short story, to writings that exist between our traditional ideas of genre: lyric essays, prose poems, factual fantasies, autofictions, literary jokes, and lies. In our discussions, we’ll come together to figure out how prose writing works, paying attention to both minute features of the sentence and large concerns of how voice, plot, and character create tension and drive meaning. Along the way, adopt these forms’ various strategies to our own writing, experimenting widely in how we can find our own unique ways of creating writing worth reading. Whether you’re an essayist, fiction writer, prose-curious poet, or someone boldly in between, please join us for an ecstatic tour of interesting writing.",

Its primary goal is to enable new students to negotiate successfully the challenges and opportunities of graduate work in English by familiarizing them with the requirements for completing the M.A. and Ph.D. and the resources available for doing so. Some class sessions will be taken up by visiting panels consisting of English department faculty and advanced Ph.D. students, and other conversations will cover concrete topics such as what goes into a qualifications statement, and how one puts together a comprehensive examination committee. We will also devote class sessions to developing research skills in the library, preparing proposals for academic conference presentations, and analyzing the editorial policies of scholarly journals.",

    "description": "Everyone studying and eventually teaching English Literature or even Cultural Studies should have a thorough understanding of the many ways in which literature and mass (or popular) culture are now understood by scholars, of the various theories (or methodologies) we \"deploy\" (whether we know it or not!) in our practical (or applied) criticism: marxism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, hermeneutics, deconstruction, etc. One way in which all such otherwise contradictory theories coincide is that they are all interested in human \"subjectivity\" (if not, alas, in one's individuality). Another and perhaps more interesting way they coincide, to be explored in this class, is that they are all either structuralist or poststructuralist. (Occasionally, though, they're both, as in the case of S/Z by Roland Barthes – and maybe even his Mythologies.) That exploration, here, will consist of close readings (by which I do not mean old-fashioned \"New Critical\" readings, necessarily) of some of the most significant works – and then significant \"texts,\" to use a term Barthes popularized – of both structuralism and poststructuralism. Students – and professor – will write short response papers to each let's just say book assigned (apart from those by Belsey and Sturrock). We will also share these papers with one another. Grades will be based on the response papers and also on attendance.\nRequired Texts:\nJohn Sturrock, Structuralism, 2nd edition      0-631-23239-7\nCatherine Belsey, Poststructuralism: A Very Short Introduction              978-0-19-280180-7\nLouis Althusser, Lenin and Philosophy: And Other Essays        0-85345-213-X\nRoland Barthes, A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments        978-0-374-53231-4\nGilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus             978-0-8166-1402-8\nPaul de Man, Allegories of Reading               0-300-02845-8\nJacques Derrida, Of Grammatology                 0-8018-5830-5\nMichel Foucault, The Order of Things            0-394-71935-2\nBarbara Johnson, The Critical Difference     0-8018-2728-0\nJulia Kristeva, Revolution in Poetic Language             978-0-231-05643-4",

    "description": "In a combined course on both analytic method and the rhetoric of scholarly argument, we will survey by example the reigning approaches to literary analysis—from William Empson and the subsequent New Criticism through structuralism, poststructuralism, deconstruction, Marxism, New Historicism, and on since to the so-called “ethical turn” and the “affective turn”—as both are frequently absorbed into “neoformalism” and the latest debates concerning “symptomatic” versus “surface” reading.  Landmark essays on literature (as well as on pictorial image and film) that pace our discussion will be read as well with an eye to their own structure of argument and rhetorical presentation.  Double-tracked with a seminar on the discourse and practice of “close reading,” therefore, will be a parallel “workshop” in academic writing in which the essays read (and other examples supplementing them) will be discussed not just for their methodological traction but as potential models of scholarly publication.\"",

    "description": "Shakespeare has survived, and indeed has continued to thrive, in part because he and his works exist and persist in a number of versions. There is the historical William Shakespeare, native of Stratford-upon-Avon: a player, a poet, and a playwright (not to mention a successful speculator in real estate). There are also the works of Shakespeare: the poems and plays that first earned him a reputation that, like those poems and plays, would be made and remade, adapted and amended for centuries to come. Then there is “Shakespeare,” a cultural icon and a global phenomenon (not to mention a successful brand). And there is the Shakespeare who inhabits the very center of our literary canon and our curriculum, transcending period boundaries and academic disciplines, ineluctably (if at times infuriatingly) influencing the ways in which we interpret and define literary activity itself.\nThis course provides an advanced introduction to all of the various versions of Shakespeare. We will spend much of our time situating Shakespeare and his works in the context of early modern England, focusing on the theatre industry in which he worked, the political and religious debates in which he intervened, the burgeoning literary culture in which he wrote, the marketplace of print that made his fame, the textual environment in which he existed (and was transformed), and the subsequent critical industry that he continues to both inspire and authorize. We will engage closely with the poems and plays, along with a wide range of critical and historical material. In addition, we will use many of the powerful digital tools that now exist for the study of Shakespeare and his age. As such, this course will also provide an introduction to early modern studies—to the major issues at stake, and more importantly to the potential of what is one of the most exciting (and technologically sophisticated) areas of literary study. The goal is to engage with a variety of approaches that will strengthen and enrich your own research and teaching.\nThe course requirements will include a variety of short research and writing assignments, culminating in a paper suitable to be delivered at a conference. Students are encouraged to find productive and provocative connections between an aspect of Shakespeare studies and their own area(s) of specialization and interest.",

    "description": "This course considers early American literature from a transnational and hemispheric perspective, with special attention to slave narrative, indigenous texts, women’s writing and the rise of the novel. Primary documents include a selection of Latin American and Franco-American works in translation as well as English-language literatures of contact, exploration, war and Revolutionary nation-building. In addition to mastery of early American texts and genres, students will acquire proficiency in tracing the entanglement of emerging literary culture with imperialist competition, commercial enterprise and the confluence of religio-spiritual frames of experience with modern, affective and secular states. Readings include Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca, Chronicles of the Narvaez Expedition; Alan Greer, ed. The Jesuit Relations: Natives and Missionaries in Seventeenth Century North America; Alden Vaughan & Edward Clark, eds. Puritans Among the Indians; Henry Louis Gates, ed, Pioneers of the Black Atlantic, Five Slave Narratives from the Enlightenment 1772-1816; Benjamin Franklin, Autobiography; Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, The Midwife’s Tale; Hannah Foster, The Coquette; Susanna Rowson, Slaves in Algiers; Black Hawk, Autobiography, and The Autobiography of a Meskwaki Woman: A New Edition and Translation (2006).

It is an intensive reading course designed to offer participants a clear history of the way that literacy and writing developed in many of the some 500 Native nations in North America. It will also provide important readings in theory, particularly those works produced by indigenous theorists who have laid the groundwork for the field of Native American Studies across the U.S. Some writers we will read in depth: Samson Occom (Mohegan), William Apess (Pequot), Gertrude Bonnin (Dakota), Jane Johnston Schoolcraft (Ojibwa). Theorists we will read include: Gerald Vizenor (Ojibwa), Paula Gunn Allen (Laguna), Beth Piatote (Niimíipu), Jodi Byrd (Chickasaw).",

Poets might include Marianne Moore, Gwendolyn Brooks, Charles Reznikoff, Bernadette Mayer, Gjertrud Schnackenberg, Pamela Lu, Cornelius Eady, Robin Coste Lewis, David Trinidad, and many others. Throughout the semester, as we draft our own sequence or long poem generated in response to our readings and discussions, we will ask ourselves, as writers, how far is far enough?

Shelley, Carlyle, and C. Brontë alongside a range of poets and poetries from this era.  But students will be expected to develop individual research projects and teaching models to supplement and engage with the assigned materials. \nThis course should be of value for students interested in methods and topics in ecocriticism, literary historicism, romanticism, and the spatial humanities.",

    "description": "M.F.K. Fisher once observed, “A writing cook and a cooking writer must be bold at the desk as well as the stove.”  In this class we will find out what America’s most celebrated culinary essayist meant as we explore the tradition of modern food writing in English ranging from early, and frequently Francophile, classics to the increasingly postcolonial cutting edge.  Examples of authors whose work we will likely read (in full or via excerpts) include Fannie Farmer, Upton Sinclair, M.F.K. Fisher, A.J. Liebling, Alice B. Toklas, Elizabeth David, Calvin Trillin, Wendell Berry, Vertamae Grosvenor, Jeffrey Steingarten, Ruth Ozeki, Austin Clarke, Anthony Bourdain, Michael Pollan, Barbara Kingsolver, David Foster Wallace, Chang-Rae Lee, Diana Abu-Jaber, Fiona Dunlop, Raj Patel, and others.  Mostly we’ll look at prose fiction and nonfiction, but there is too much great food-themed poetry (e.g., William Carlos Williams, Elizabeth Bishop, Rita Dove, Lorna Dee Cervantes) to make us feel justified at being anything less than as omnivorous in our approach.  Along the way, as well, we will gain some familiarity with several theorists whose work is commonly cited by humanities-oriented food studies scholars (Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Douglas, Bourdieu, Appadurai, and others), and we’ll explore the wonderfully rich but under-utilized Louis Szathmary Culinary Archive, a gift to the University of Iowa from the estate of the Hungarian-born and later Chicago-based celebrity chef and writer Louis Szathmary,  \nThe class being a seminar, all students will develop a major project.  Presumably most will prefer to pursue the traditional option of a carefully researched and lovingly written seminar paper focused on one or more of the texts we have studied in the class, including perhaps material from the Szathmary Culinary Archive.  We will equip ourselves with the skills for executing such an assignment through a series of preliminary steps along the way:  working in subgroups to identify important and/or recent scholarship on specific texts, summarizing that scholarship both orally and in writing for classmates, writing a short abstract about your chosen topic, and constructing an annotated bibliography.  But I would also be delighted to entertain (do-able-in-a-semester) ideas for innovative and/or collaborative projects, for instance in the digital humanities or creative writing.\nThe prerequisite for enrollment is that you are a graduate student who likes to think about (and hopefully eat) food.  Medievalists, early Americanists, NWP and WW students, historians, anthropologists—all, and more, are welcome to join in.  I’ll bring to the table what I know about food writing and food studies, I’ll help us as a class build a relationship with the research librarians who know how to navigate the Szathmary Archive, and then your contributions will be the element of potluck.",

This course provides personal experiences with mindfulness practices, taught in a secular way, using your self as a laboratory to investigate their relevance for daily living and working. This process includes the cultivation of inquiry, attention, reflection, awareness of internal emotional, cognitive and physical experiences and attitudes associated with mindfulness. These attitudes support openness to change, clarity of intention, acceptance and wise, compassionate action. This personal understanding will be applied to the broader concepts, theories, and research on mindfulness related to academic skills, the neuroscience of self-regulation of emotional reactivity; stress resilience; interpersonal skills, health, and well-being. Students will have opportunity to apply their learning to individual interst areas including education, psychology/counseling, human relations, healthcare, etc.\n \nCOURSE REQUIREMENTS:  Mindfulness is learned from our own experience so this will be reflected in how the course is structured and taught. We will meet for 2 hours 10 minutes once per week with an additional extended class on a Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Attendance at the first class is expected as the groundwork is laid for the reminder of the course.   Classes will be interactive, participatory, and collaborative. Outside of class, students will be expected to do 20-30 minutes/day of guided mindfulness meditation practice (at least 5 days a week) with MP3 tracks provided.

In this course, we will investigate factors which keep college students from being successful and graduating in strong standing. While some students lack study skills and academic preparation, others succumb to alcohol and other drug use and abuse, gambling, or credit card debt. We will also consider other issues leading to dropping out of school, including depression, dating violence, and simply not fitting in. Much of the course will be driven by student interest; participants will pick topics, find readings, research their topics, and lead a class discussion on their topic.",

    "description": "This is a first course in multivariate statistical methods.  Topics include basic matrix concepts (a brief introduction), sample geometry and related concepts for MV data analysis, the multivariate normal distribution and associated MV significance tests, principal components analysis (PCA), common factory analysis (CFA), discriminant analysis (DA) and canonical correlations (CCA), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).  The intent is to familiarize students with multivariate methods in such a way that awareness of the foundations of techniques is developed as well as appreciation for practical applications.  A major goal of instruction is that students develop a sufficient conceptual foundation in multivariate methods to evaluate literature that uses these techniques as welll as grasp basic ideas behind methods not specifically covered in this course.  Because a primary goal of the course is that students understand how multivariate methods work, the use of \"canned\" statistical routines will be avoided in the beginning of the course.  Instead, students will be provided with sample computer programs that use matrix routines from SAS's PROC IML, and may use them to perform the more rudimentary techniques in multivariate analysis.  This merely uses a computer as a giant calculator; no original programming is required.  The examples from IML will be complemented by illustrations from pre-packaged procedures to facilitate interpretation of essential information from PROC GLM and PROC ANOVA.  We will use packaged programs in SAS for the more complex techniques of DA, CFA, CCA and certain MANOVA problems.  Students  specializing in Measurement and Statistics may be given special computer assignments for self-study to deepen their understanding of multivariate methods and sharpen their programming skills.",

William., Rollnick, Stephen (2002) Motivational Interviewing Second Edition\nCourse Description: This course will define and address the fundamental concepts of Motivational Interviewing and the Stages of Change model. The use of these approaches with particular emphasis on persons with substance use disorders will be explored. This course will teach that Motivational Interviewing is a style of working with persons with addictive behavior disorders designed to increase motivation for change. This course will teach students to match interventions to six stages of readiness-for-change. It will emphasize motivational strategies that include how to help the client/patient resolve ambivalence impasses that impede change, how to draw upon internal motivation to work in a positive direction and how to remove obstacles to change. A combination of lecture, readings, videos, large and small group discussion will be used to advance students knowledge and understanding of Motivational Interviewing. In addition, heavy emphasis is placed on classroom discussion and role-play activities\nClass Attendance Policy: students are expected to attend class. Points will be tabulated for attendance; attendance at each class is worth 2.5 points, equaling a total of 35 points.\nLearning Environment Expectations: students are responsible for material covered in class as well as assigned material. If students miss a class it is expected that they will still be responsible for the covered material. Students are expected to come to class prepared.\nCourse Requirements:  regularly attend class, participate and contribute to classroom discussion; one exam = 150 points, small group classroom presentations =125 points, classroom participation = 30 points; attendance = 35 points; small group activities; small group presentations = 125 points. Students will randomly be assigned one of the Stages of Change from the Stages of Change Model. A classroom presentation will be expected of each small group.\nCourse Objectives: by the end of this course, students will demonstrate knowledge of: the conceptual and research background supporting MI, the concept of ambivalence and the critical conditions necessary for change, the guiding principles of MI and a practical description of the approach, knowledge of specific strategies for building motivation and strengthening commitment to change, and knowledge of MI and the Stages-of-Change model; application with various populations\nEvaluation Procedures:  active participation is mandatory for the full realization of the course goals. In order to pass the course, the following expectations must be met: all reading assignments completed before class time; active involvement in class discussion, note taking, small group activities; completion of required one (1) exam; full participation and involvement in your assigned small group classroom presentation; and adherence to attendance requirement.",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to backpack through Europe? Where would you go, who would you meet? What stories would you tell when you got back? In this course, Professor Roxanna Curto draws upon her experience as a researcher-writer for the Let’s Go travel guides (Let’s Go, Western Europe 2002) to lead you on an imaginary tour of Western Europe, with stops in Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and Barcelona.\nAt each stop, we will learn basic information about the city’s culture and major sites, and sample a local treat. For Dublin, we will discuss Dublin Castle, Christchurch Cathedral, St. Stephens Green, Trinity College (including the Book of Kells) and the Guinness Storehouse. We will then spend two days in London, touring the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. After a ride on the Eurostar train under the English Channel, we will arrive in Amsterdam, and learn about the Anne Frank House, Rembrandt Museum, “coffee shop” scene, and red light district. For our next stop, we will “stay” in Paris, where we will virtually visit the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Centre Pompidou, Musée d’Orsay and Arc de Triomphe. In Berlin, we will “see” Brandenburg Gate, the Bundestag (formerly Reichstag), and learn about the former divisions between East and West with a tour of the Stasi Prison Museum and remnants of the Berlin Wall. In Geneva, we will take a boat ride in the lake and see the Jet d’Eau, and visit the St. Pierre Cathedral, CERN and the UN headquarters. We will then board the train to Italy, where we will first stop in Florence. In Florence, we will view the greatest collection of Italian Renaissance art in the world at the Uffizi Gallery, walk over the Ponte Vecchio, and see Michelangelo’s David, as well as Santa Maria del Fiore (Duomo). In Venice, we will cruise the cities canals and learn about its unique history. During our visit to Rome, we will walk through the Roman Forum, Vatican Museums, St. Peter’s Basilica and Coliseum. Our trip will end in Barcelona, where we will see La Sagrada Familia, the Barcelona Cathedral, and Gaudi architecture, before hitting the beach.\nOver the course of the semester, you will be introduced to Irish and British English, and learn to say, “Hello,” “Good-bye,” “Please,” and “Thank you” in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. You will be expected to prepare for each class period by planning an itinerary for each city, including which attractions to visit. Each week, you will also write a journal entry in an online blog, and respond to your classmates’ entries.",

This course, approved for the General Education Interpretation of Literature program, serves as an introduction to well-known works of the French literary tradition. Focus will be on critical reading techniques, in-class discussion, and writing assignments that will discuss themes, characters, concepts and historical dimensions of the various works we will read. Although this is not primarily a history or culture course, we will view literary works as inroads into the understanding of different cultural formations across historical time. Thus we will be getting a sense for the differences between Medieval culture and the Renaissance as it manifested itself in France; also for the major flashpoints in the chronological unfolding of modernity in France, through the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and up to the end of the twentieth century opening onto the present day. The various social trends we observe will bring us to ask questions about gender, power, social class, environment and identity, all through the lens of literary language and the storytelling it carries out.",

The class is taught exclusively in French. Discussions are based upon short literary texts, music, cinema, and other visual arts, on a variety of themes such as: family; cultural differences; climate change; student life and education in France and Québec; immigration; social media; etc. Although grammar is not the primary focus of the course, each chapter in the textbook facilitates grammar review. The main focus is to increase your ease of speaking and communicating as naturally as possible in the language. Grades are based upon class participation, attendance, debates, dictées, a midterm oral exam, and a final oral exam.",

In this course that is taught exclusively in French, students learn how to refine their pronunciation, strengthen their ability to function in various communicative contexts, handle stylistic variations and idiomatic expressions, and communicate as naturally as possible in the language. Students also learn to use proper grammatical constructions and vocabulary to narrate, describe, compare, convince, or articulate opinions and hypotheses. We use samples of oral productions in France and Francophone regions of the world such as the Caribbean, Europe, Québec, Sub-Saharan Africa, and others in order to emphasize and discuss differences in pronunciation and vocabulary use across French-speaking countries. This exercise also allows students to improve their oral-aural skills in a global French-speaking perspective.\nA special aspect of the course called “Bridging the French class with the French-speaking Iowa City community” will focus on the dynamics individual students will generate by actively using their speaking skills to help the Iowa City community. This activity may include for example volunteering as interpreters and translators at Alexander, Wood, and Twain Elementary Schools or at IC Compassion.\nGrades are based upon class participation, attendance, homework, debates, dictées, a midterm oral exam, and a video project. Dictées are the most complete activity to develop oral-aural and writing skills. They will be given regularly throughout the semester. Debates will focus on the films watched in class and on topics such as: social media; new technologies; cultural differences; social justice; international humanitarian assistance, the environment; climate and political refugees, health care in France and the US; student life and tuition fees in France, the US and Quebec; immigration; etc.\n Course materials focusing on films, music, news media (print media, radio and television, and online news) and other visual arts will be made available in class and on CANVAS.",

Focusing on the seminal earliest texts to the latest literary, cinematic and artistic productions of the 21st century, the course explores the complex encounters between the European and the African worlds, the colonial exhibitions of Africans in Europe, decolonization, postcolonial mentalities, the Negritude movement, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, gender dynamics, the perilous migrations and exiles to Europe, the fragmented identities of homeless children, the social media landscape, and the effects of the International Monetary Funds’ Structural Adjustment Programs on African communities. The course will also observe the involvement of African soldiers (Tirailleurs sénégalais) in World War I and World War II, and the exhibition of African art in Parisian museums.\nInitiatives such as of the Pan-African Great Green Wall program that seeks to fight against land degradation, desertification and climate change from Dakar to Djibouti, enhance food security and employment, and transform the arid regions of the Sahel and the Sahara into vital hubs for a rural, sustainable and green economy will also broaden our reflections. As such, the course provides an insightful critical introduction to the field of Francophone sub-Saharan African studies. No prior knowledge of the historical periods and cultures is expected.\nStudents will also have the opportunity to interact with writers and filmmakers via Skype.\nGrades are based on constructive and regular participation in class discussions, one take-home exam, one oral presentation, and a final research paper.\nNon-French speaking students with good reading proficiency, and listening skills in French are welcome to the course. They will be allowed to participate to class discussions, write their essays, and give their presentations in English.\nRequired readings are listed below in ‘Textbooks and Resources’\nSelected poems by Leopold Sedar Senghor, and short excerpts from Michel Leiris’ L’Afrique fantôme, Aminata Traoré’s L’Afrique humiliée, Achille Mbembe’s Critique de la raison nègre and Felwine Sarr’s Afrotopia will provide additional critical insight.\nSome of these films will complement our analysis of the issues under study: \nJean-Marie Teno’s Le malentendu colonial, Ousmane Sembène’s Camp de Thiaroye, Anne-Laure Folly’s Femmes aux yeux ouverts, Raoul Peck’s Sometimes in April, Marie-France Collard’s and Patrick Czaplinski’s Rwanda 94, Abderrahmane Sissako’s Bamako and Timbuktu,",

    "description": "No knowledge of French necessary; credit available also for French majors. \nIn this course we explore the literature, art, history, and social framework of seventeenth-century France under Louis XIV. At the center of the course is a work of architecture and landscaping--the palace and grounds of Versailles--that has come to represent both baroque and classical esthetic sensibilities and the political culture of absolute monarchy. Through readings of works of literature and cultural history, we will aim to get a sense for how members of the court at Versailles defined their own social roles within a rapidly changing society that included new spheres of public and private existence. Authors to be studied will include La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Molière, and Saint-Simon. Historical and theoretical approaches will be drawn from the work of Jean-Marie Apostolidès, Roger Chartier, Joan DeJean, Norbert Elias, Daniel Gordon, and Pierre Goubert among others. Work for the course will include preparation of readings (in French for students taking the course for French credit; in translation for non-French-speaking students) and participation in class discussions, three short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Print resources will be complemented by a survey of films, websites, and CDroms devoted to Versailles. Students of all majors and backgrounds welcome.",

    "description": "This graduate seminar, taught in French, will examine the 19th-Century récit—both novels and short stories—in conjunction with classic works of narratology. The objectives of the course are twofold. First, to study the major works and authors of 19th-Century France in their historical and cultural contexts, focusing on their relationship to literary movements: Romanticism, Realism, the Fantastic and Naturalism. Second, to provide an introduction to literary criticism and theory by reading seminal essays on the analysis of stories, primarily from structuralism and Russian formalism, in order to learn a variety of methodologies for approaching narrative prose.\nIn our discussions, we will ponder some of the following questions: How does theory/criticism define literature as a category or object of study? How are narratives constructed—what are their elements? How do characters develop? What is the role of description in narrative? What constitutes an action or event, and what forms a plot? How does the focalizer function in direct and indirect discourse? To what extent are scientific or rational discourses adopted or rejected? What is the impact of the Industrial Revolution on literature? How do artistic trends, such as Realist painting, influence literature of this period? How does the rise of modernity, especially the dissemination of technological innovations, transform representations of reality? Finally, to what extent do these narratives conform to the structuralist concepts used to analyze them, and which textual elements resist inclusion in a narratological framework?\nStudents will be required to participate actively in class discussions, write weekly response papers, take three exams, and present an MLA-style paper (10 pages, double-spaced) to the class. Discussion questions to help prepare for each class will be distributed via e-mail on Fridays.\nPrimary Texts (in chronological order):\nFrançois-René Chateaubriand, René (1802)\nHonoré de Balzac, « Sarrasine » (1830) and « L’auberge rouge » (1831)\nStendhal, Le Rouge et le noir (1830)\nProsper Mérimée, La Vénus d’Ille (1835/1837)\nGustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary (1856) and L’Éducation sentimentale: Histoire d’un jeune homme (1869)\nGuy de Maupassant, Contes fantastiques: « Un fou » (1884), « Le Horla » (1887) and « Qui sait ? » (1890)\nÉmile Zola, Germinal (1885)",

    "description": "Men of honor, loyalty, and respect: Hollywood has an enduring fascination with mobsters. Over the last forty years, successful movies by Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, and Martin Scorsese have contributed to shape the myth of the Mafia and keep it alive in the American imaginary. This course will explore this myth and re-discuss its function through a selection of Italian films. It will investigate the multifaceted nature of Italian organized crime considering its historical, geographical, social, and economical dimensions. In particular, it will analyze how 21st century Italian cinema portrays the Mafia in films such as Angela (2002), Galantuomini (Brave Men, 2008), Gomorra (Gomorrah, 2008), and Anime nere (Black Souls, 2014). Finally, this course will explore how five recent movies I cento passi (One Hundred Steps, 2000), Alla luce del sole (Come Into the Light, 2005), Fortapàsc (Fort Apache, 2008), La siciliana ribelle (The Sicilian Girl, 2008), and La mafia uccide solo estate (The Mafia Only Kills in Summer, 2013) pay tribute to the anti-mafia resistance. The course is taught in English. Films are in Italian with English subtitles.",

    "description": "Everyone knows Italian food. Scholars argue that Italian cooking has had a greater impact upon the development of eating habits than any other national cuisine. Would you like to learn how the Italians come to eat so well, and how Italian cuisine came to be thrust into today's global limelight? If you are interested in food, and if you like Italian food in particular, you will enjoy the learning experience offered by this one-hour course!\n \nHow did pasta and pizza become Italian culinary staples and trademarks? Why did Mussolini champion risotto? How did the mainstream American concept of Italian food develop from a mixture of regional traditions and local dishes? What is the Slow Food movement, and why is it spreading from Italy to the rest of the world? These are some of the topics we will discuss during the semester. But we will not just talk about food: be prepared to re-create and taste some of the dishes mentioned in the class materials! We will also work on improving your reading and note-taking strategies, writing skills, using UI Library resources, and managing group projects.\n \nFinal grade will be based on the following: attendance (20%); regular participation in class discussions (20%); four short writing assignments reflecting on the materials studied, which include readings and films (20%); a small-group oral presentation (20%); and a “show-tell-and eat” culinary project (20%).",

While the primary focus will be Dante’s work, other texts and media will be introduced as necessary to enhance the reading.\nThrough this course students will: 1) become familiar with Dante’s Inferno; 2) explore its historical, cultural, and social context; 3) critically approach Dante’s narrative and learn strategies for analyzing a foreign language classic; 4) gain a deeper appreciation of the enduring beauty of Dante’s poetry; 4) investigate how the Comedy has been read and re-read and how it has influenced world literature and art; 5) reflect upon how Dante’s insight into human nature, although rooted in medieval culture, is as relevant today as it was in the 14th century.\nCourse is taught in English, with a discussion session in Italian for students enrolled for 4 s.h. Students must take this course for 4 s.h. in order to count it toward the minor or major in Italian.

    "description": "\"I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia.  It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.\"  (Winston Churchill, 1941)   Despite the official break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, this famous quote perhaps rings more true today than ever – even to the vast majority of so-called Russian experts and academics. It is my hope that throughout the course of this semester students will come away with an improved understanding of the unique historical, political, socio-economic, cultural, and literary events of the past 100 years that continue to guide and influence Russia in 2017 as one of the world’s most unique, powerful, yet perpetually misunderstood countries. Course materials will include literary works by Russian authors, biographers, and historians (in English), documentary and artistic films (by both Russian and US directors),  government and NGO presentations on the changing health care system post-1991, and a several specialist guest speakers on Russian law, education, economics, the former Soviet Republics, and youth culture today in Russia.",

It will also open a window onto the unique history of the rich multi-ethnic culture of Ukraine, its unique musical traditions, and the story of its centuries-long search for a national identity. \nThe seminar will start from the discussion of current events in August 2014 –– i.e., post-EuroMaidan and post-annexation of Crimea.  During the first week of classes, we will read various Western news reports on Russian-Ukrainian relations, the role of the West, and we will record our conclusions at that initial level of our engagement with the country.  Then we will step by step cover the following topics: \n\nOverview of Ukrainian history;\nUkraine's multi-ethnic population today;\nThe Story of the Cossacks in Ukraine and Elsewhere;\ndumas);\nThe Making of Ukrainian Jew/Life in a shtetl;\nControversy of Stepan Bandera and Ukrainian Insurgent Army;\nArtificially Created Famine of the 1930s (Holodomor);\nFrom 2004 \"Orange Revolution\" to 2013 Maidan.  \n\nIn the last week, we will re-visit the current events, and see whether our interpretation of these will have changed as the result of our studies.\nAll readings will be in English, no knowledge of Russian or Ukrainian is required.  In addition to readings, we will screen several films and several times through semester will establish real-time skype connections to artists and intellectuals in Kiev, Ukraine.

    "description": "You came here to continue learning the fifth most widely spoken language in the world. As you already probably know, 278 million Earthlings speak Russian, of them 164 million speak it as their first langauge. A few other facts about Russian: it is the largest native language in Europe; it is one of the official languages of the UN; it is the 10th most widely spoken languages in the U.S.; one in every 372 Americans over age five uses Russian in the home. The Defense Language Institute classifies Russian as a “Level III” language, meaning it has a very high degree of difficulty and requires 789 or more hours of immersive instruction to attain intermediate fluency (See “Russian Life” May/June 2009). It means, in order to master Russian, you need to get more hours, combining your work in class with homework.  The course is focused on the basic skills to achieve successful communication: pronunciation, vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing. You will sing the Russian songs, memorize the Russian words and write dictations, listen to real Russian dialogues and monologues, discuss, play out the situations, play games, learn to tell Russian jokes (anekdoty), and will write various kinds of essays. At the end of the second year you will be able to pass basic level of TORFL, i.e., the “Russian as a Foreign Language” test. This test was designed as part of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. It started in 1992, and by 1998 it became obligatory for those wishing to study at a Russian university.",

    "description": "This is a current events course focused on U.S. relations with Asia Pacific nations. While American involvement in Middle Eastern wars and counter-insurgency operations against ISIS command daily media attention, U.S. economic and strategic interests in the Asia Pacific region are arguably a more critical area of U.S. foreign policy.  Many people are aware of the explosive growth of U.S. trade relations with China, but less aware of the extent of U.S. regional trade with Asia.  In fact, four of America’s top trading partners are East Asian countries and Asia has the world’s most dynamic and fastest growing economies. Strategically, the U.S. has more troops stationed in East Asia than any other region; in fact, 40% of U.S. military assets are located in just two Asian countries: South Korea and Japan.  It is too soon to tell how—if at all—U.S. policy in the Asia Pacific relation will change under the Trump Administration.  But in line with his pledge to ‘put America first’, on the campaign trail Mr. Trump promised major changes in U.S. trade and strategic partnerships in Asia. How will relations actually change?  Understanding U.S. interests and the implication of policy dynamics in the Asian Pacific region has never been more important.This is a current events course and the readings will focus on current news stories. The primary source of news will be the New York Times; through the Student Readership Program, UI student have free access to both the print and electronic editions. (One purpose of this course is to instill in freshmen the habit of reading quality news media.) In the first two weeks there will be short lectures on the pre-2016 history of U.S. Asia Pacific relations and introduce students to basic concepts of news analysis such as sourcing of stories, fact checking, and new frame analysis. Starting the third week students will select and report on news stories.  Each student will report twice during the semester. Grades will be based on attendance, discussion, and students’ oral and written reports.  The instructor is Professor Vlastos.",

This class will explore the rise and transformation of Rome from plundered imperial city to Christian capital by examining such topics as the religious life of the city, architectural evolution, and the place of Rome in the broader politics of early medieval Europe. Graded assignments will consist of short quizzes, a final project, and a midterm and final exam.",

We will explore the revolution from its origins during times of growing inequality in the late nineteenth century, to its conclusion as major political change took root in the mid-twentieth century. Participants came from all walks of life, and leaders had varied ideas on what was best for the people of Mexico. Which leaders and ideas survived to shape Mexican society, and why – and how are they remembered? We will tackle this topic by studying primary sources, novels, film, art, and texts, allowing students to develop their own interpretation of this revolution. This class will also help students improve their writing. A short written exercise will be due every other week. Students will also be graded on class discussions, an essay, and a final exam.",

Each community has participated in local politics and in the creation of local cultures, while remaining part of a Jewish Diaspora, held together to varying degrees by ethnic identity and religious tradition. Focusing on Jews in the Middle East, Europe, the United States and Latin America, we will study how Jewish identity is constructed and how Jews negotiate their relationships with each other, with non-Jews in their local societies, and with other Jewish communities. For example, how have Jews integrated in to American society? In what ways have they affected non-Jewish Americans? In addition to surveying the history of different groups of Jewish people(s), we will ask what it means to be a Jews today.The instructor is Ari Ariel.",

What was achieved and at what cost?  Why was communism popular in Western Europe and much of the world in the early twentieth century? How does social democracy differ from communism? Was the USSR defeated in the Cold War or did its fall come about primarily as a result of internal collapse? These are some of the questions which will guide us as we explore the ideas and events which shaped this world-transforming event, the struggles which followed, the influence of the USSR around the world and the legacy it left upon its collapse.  Much of our reading material will be primary sources in the forms of theoretical writings and political speeches from the period under study. Students will be asked to locate and discuss additional primary sources. Grading will be based upon quizzes, classroom participation, in-class presentations, written assignments and exams.The Instructor is Michael Andrew Žmolek.",

    "description": "The typical postwar American woman is often nostalgically depicted as the picture of domesticity and femininity - an idealized wife, mother, and homemaker who represented suburbia, family life, and all that American prosperity could provide – in essence, the “American dream.” But what about the larger context for that popular portrayal of postwar American life? Is this image of the American woman as perfect and uniform as it has been portrayed? What about those who were left out of this white, middle-class, suburban ideal? This course seeks to complicate the gendered depiction of women in Cold War America by exploring how socio-cultural roles for American men and women fit in the larger structure of the Cold War, as American Cold War ideology depended so heavily on conformity and strict gender roles, as well as how many women used that same ideology to rethink and expand women’s roles, even as the expectations of popular culture seemed to be relegating them to the home. By working with primary and secondary materials, students will explore how American conceptions of gender roles and positions in society changed over the course of the Cold War, as well as their implications for the present day. Student performance will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, a paper, and a midterm and final exam. The instructor is Danielle Hoskins.",

Focusing on LGBTQI sexualities, this course examines the categories, models, and languages that shaped how Americans and Europeans understood and negotiated their sexed, sexual, and embodied lives.  Of particular interest will be how American and European notions of sex and sexuality crossed borders, influencing understandings of what sex meant. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which different race, class, and gender identities influenced such understandings of sex from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries. Student performance will be evaluated on the basis of participation, a midterm exam, an essay, and a final exam. The instructor is Caroline Radesky.",

    "description": "To understand the genesis of Buddhism as the most modern of world religions, this course will begin with the story of the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who reached Enlightenment around the fifth century BCE. After the Buddha passed away, Buddhist schools proliferated. We will first identify some of the main features of Theravada Buddhism. We will then explore the history and practices of several major Mahayana Buddhist schools, especially esoteric Buddhism and Zen in Japan. In the 1850s, Japanese arts and crafts began to flood European shores and transformed Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. They also entered museums and became a familiar sight across the U.S. today. Little known is the fact that traditional Japanese art was imbued with Buddhist principles. We will examine some of the basic aesthetic principles and concepts that encompass Japanese arts and crafts. We will have a quick glance at the Western \"discovery\" of Buddhism and their joint efforts with Asian Buddhists to make sense of Buddhism in scientific terms in the modern period. As a case study, we will review the early history of Japanese Zen in the United States that gave rise to an indigenous American Zen tradition which also influences the Western (Zen) world. Meditation functions at the heart of Buddhist practice. We will take a look at the Dalai Lama's collaboration with contemporary scientists to fathom the extraordinary power of meditation.This general education course breaks down into two classes: both are about seventy minutes long, with a ten-minute break between the two. Each class combines lectures with in-class activities that encourage students to engage with readings in an interactive and hands-on manner.This course will have two short papers, one long paper, one in-class presentation, a midterm and final exam.Books include: 1) Yanagi, Muneyoshi, and Bernard Leach. Unknown Craftsman: A Japanese Insight into Beauty.

    "description": "Lately we have been hearing much about President Trump’s proposed border wall, but have you ever wondered about the Berlin Wall? What conditions led it to be built, and what led it to be dismantled? THIS COURSE IS FOR YOU! In this course, we will examine the history of Berlin from the “rubble years” after World War II, through the building Cold War crisis, the construction of the Wall, student unrest and anti-authoritarian protests in West Berlin, atomic anxieties of the 1980s, and the “peaceful revolution” in the East that led to the Wall’s opening in 1989.This course will help you answer the following questions: Why was the Wall built and what did it mean when US President John F. Kennedy said, “Ick bin ein Berliner”? What was everyday life like under state socialism in the East and how and why did some try to escape East Berlin? Who were the “Stasi” and how did they spy on the residents of East Berlin? Why did West Berlin become the capital of alternative culture and the squatter scene? How did everyday people resist state socialist control and contribute to the Wall’s opening in November 1989? And finally, what happened to Berliners after the Wall’s opening?This general education course combines brief lectures with in-class activities that encourage students to engage with readings in a more interactive and hands-on manner. In this course, students will develop critical reading and writing skills, while gaining confidence participating in classroom discussions. This course will also incorporate many visual cultures sources, including films, performance and video art, and photography. Many readings will be accessible on ICON to reduce cost to the student.Students will be asked to write three short papers, which will be workshopped in small groups in class. They will be asked to transform one of the short papers into a longer historical essay. This course will have a midterm and final exam.  The instructor is Briana Smith.",

What accounts for this discrepancy, and can history help explain it? This course will examine the history of health and health disparities from colonial times to the present. We will focus on the Global South (or the former “Third World”) – Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean – to understand how culture, economics, politics, global encounters, and more contributed to the making of health discourse, practice, and inequality. Many familiar historical topics (like slavery, the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, missionary and imperial medicine, and the emergence of the movement for human rights) have radically shaped and transformed health since the early modern period.

    "description": "Introduction to Islamic Civilization is a historical survey of Islamic institutions, communities, literature, arts, sciences, cultures, and practices since the 7th century. This course is for students with an interest in learning about the Islamic civilization, the religious practices and beliefs, and/or the history or the regions where Muslims are in the majority.  We will examine the traditions and main social and legal institutions of Islam. Arguably, Islam, as a major system of beliefs and practices in the world, affects both Muslims and non-Muslims. Consequently, besides examining the basic tenets, texts, and ideas of the Islamic civilization, this course focuses on the variety of ways in which Muslims and non-Muslims have understood and interpreted Islam. We will review the discussions surrounding the life of the Prophet of Islam, Islamic pre-modern and modern history, the place and role of individuals and society, the legal and economic status of women, and Islamic governments and movements. As a survey course, we will examine these topics through an interdisciplinary approach: we will apply textual, legal/normative, anthropological, geographical, sociological, analytical, linguistic, and historical methodologies. \nOne of the aims of this course is to give voice to Islamic texts and provide a window into how Muslims, in varying socio-historical contexts, view themselves and how they view others. We will address specific topics such as Islamic doctrines and law, philosophy, Sufi mysticism, Islamic science and arts, gender issues, politics, the ongoing debate between modernism and traditionalism in contemporary Islamic societies, and Islam in the West. The course is ultimately an attempt to understand Islam as an idea and as a process, never as a static and crystallized snapshot of the world through the eyes of any specific group inside or outside the Muslim community.\nMinimally, students will learn basic definitions of key terms and concepts, identify major social and political trends, locate demographic and political centers within the Islamic world, understand legal and philosophical norms, contextualize historical events, expose hidden and public tensions within and without Muslim and/or non-Muslim communities, and acquire a basic understanding of the origins, developments, and limits of the Islamic civilization.",

    "description": "Django Unchained, Twelve Years a Slave, Nate Parker’s Birth of a Nation – just a glance at recent movie titles reminds us that the history of African Americans in slavery and freedom remains a topic of public interest and debate in the twenty-first century.  Although historians argue about how accurately and inclusively these films represent slavery and the slave experience, each film does engage with real aspects of that history.  Husbands and wives were separated by the domestic slave trade – free blacks were kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South – enslaved men and women resisted in myriad ways, including armed rebellion.  This course is an opportunity to learn and understand more about all of the above, while gaining a foundation in early African American history more broadly.African American History to 1877 offers a survey of African American history from African origins and the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade to emancipation and Reconstruction following the U.S. Civil War.  Major topics will include the development of a race-based slavery in the North and South; gradual emancipation and the development of a free black community in the North; slave resistance and the black abolitionist movement; growing sectional tensions and the Civil War; and emancipation and new political rights post-1865.  This course centers the experiences of free and enslaved African Americans, as well as their contributions to larger national debates about race and slavery in the nation.  We will pay particular attention to the way that racial and gender ideologies shaped African American men and women’s experiences in slavery and freedom.  The course will also consider the ways that African Americans and the history of slavery are portrayed in popular culture and memory, such as the feature films mentioned above.  Primary sources, fiction, film and documentaries, and traditional secondary sources will form the basis of our study.",

    "description": "This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n \nAs part of the University of Iowa’s “Big Ideas” curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the “Age of Petroleum,” an age in which we continue to live.\n \nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years? What were the factors behind oil’s emergence as the world’s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth’s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n \n \n \nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for “Historical Perspectives,” students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n \n \n \nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

How do we decide when, where, and how government acts—in ways that are consistent with our social goals and values? Policy Matters will focus on a selection of our most pressing social issues such as education, inequality, labor standards, and health care.  On each of these topics, we will devote attention to the historical development of the problem or policy in question (both to provide background, and to help students imagine historical alternatives).  We will trace the ways in which we address these social issues and engage students in critically analysis (through evaluation and comparison) of both the effectiveness of current policies and the universe of policy alternatives. And we will examine the ways in which social science contributes to both policy design and policy assessment (How do we know what works?).   The course will be co-taught by Sarah Bruch (Sociology) and Colin Gordon (History), with the participation of other UI faculty (and members of the community) on given topics.",

In an effort to overcome the entrenched narrative traditions that portray early American history as the steady march of the particular brand of Anglo-American settler colonialism that ultimately gave rise to the American republic, this course highlights the wide variety, unevenness, and contingent nature of American historical developments. The goal of the course is to give students a greater appreciation of how early America was shaped by the experiences of a rich variety of peoples, and how older approaches that focus almost exclusively on the actions of Europeans are fundamentally flawed.\n \nThe course is organized into weekly lecture and discussion sections. Assignments include written assignments focused on the analysis of evidence from historical text and two take-home exams.",

We will explore traditions in politics, social organization, thought, religion, and culture, and the implications of China’s revolutionary modernization for our world today. Attendance is required at two lectures and one hour of discussion each week. The discussion class is to allow you to talk about the readings and lectures in a small group; participation is required (that is, not just attendance, but coming prepared and contributing to the discussion) and, together with regular quizzes given in the discussion to encourage you not to fall behind in your reading.",

    "description": "Our journey into the modern era begins with a survey of the wide diversity of human societies as they had developed up to the era of global connections and European conquest, starting in the fifteenth century, and an overview of what the world looked like and how international connections were organized in the sixteenth century. We shall endeavor to understand how non-European societies were affected by their encounters with Europe, including how colonization was resisted and how the later spread of capitalism and industrialization re-shaped the fabric of vastly different societies. Our journey concludes with an examination of the first and second world wars, looking at their impacts across the globe. A predominant theme will be how imperialism drew nearly all of the world's diverse peoples into its orbit, culminating in the vast destruction of the Second World War, which in turn undid both the European and the Japanese imperial projects. Grading is based upon participation, a presentation and essay on a topic outside Europe and/or North America, a mid-term and a final exam.",

What do historians do?  Can disease be seen as a historical actor?  What is revealed about an event when we look at health and disease?  In this course we will answer these questions.  As a class we will talk about the types of documents historians use.  We will explore both primary and secondary sources, how we find them, read them, ask questions of them and integrate them into a historical argument.  While we do this we will also read the works of historians who have discussed how diseases have revealed relations of power between class, nation, gender, and race in history.  In the process students will identify a research topic relating to the broad theme “disease and power”.  As a class we will work together in crafting this paper in stages: 1) coming up with possible topics, 2) identifying primary and secondary sources available at the library, 3) outlining a possible argument, 4) drafting and sharing the paper, 5) and revising a final draft.  The instructor is Professor Mariola Espinosa.",

    "description": "The long history of China nurtures a culture that differs from those of the western societies in many ways. The understandings of self and society and such emotions as love and friendship among Chinese populations especially exemplify these differences. In this class, we explore the concepts of family, love, and friendship in Chinese culture and their changes by reading a selection of primary and secondary sources and by writing about them. This class assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history. All readings and discussions will be in English.This course is to help history majors to develop their skills of historical thinking, reading, research, and writing. Specifically, this class has two objectives; first, to introduce students to the methods, sources, and practices of history through the study of family and social relationships in Chinese culture; second, to provide students a broad conceptual framework on self and society in traditional and contemporary China. Research and writing assignments will develop the reading, writing, and information literacy skills necessary to succeed as a history major. Students leaving this class will be familiar with the analysis of a range of primary and secondary sources, comfortable with historical writing, and prepared for advanced coursework and independent research.  The instructor is Professor Shuang Chen.",

    "description": "A city upon a hill, an empire for freedom, the land of boundless opportunity, a country of extremes, the bully of the free world, the world’s last best hope. The intensely ideological nature of American national identity as well as the strong and diverse responses the country has elicited over centuries around the globe, offer a rich research opportunity for cultural historians with an interdisciplinary appetite and international interest. In this Introduction to the History Major  we explore America as a model, a projection, an idea – both from within and from abroad. Our time frame extends from the Puritan errand into the wilderness to the current global hegemon in decline. Rather than following a history of events, however, we will identify major themes in American self-representations and foreign perceptions and trace their changing meaning over time. Our primary source base will be a set of – mainly American - seminal documents (including novels, films and travel accounts) on the concepts of race, providence, freedom, and human nature and on the realities of slavery, inequality, power and dissent. These will be complemented by European and Asian experiences with, critiques and appropriations of the “first modern nation.” We study American visions of religious and political freedom, promises of economic opportunity and technological advances and outcries against racism, prejudice and abuse of power. At the same time we will examine how other societies and cultures used “America” to work out their own ambivalence over modernity.",

    "description": "Sexual experimentation among religious groups is applauded by some as freedom from the constraints of dogmatic religions and scorned by others as abominable behavior by amoral people.  Although ideas about proper sexual behavior are deeply ingrained in the American psyche those ideas receive little attention until a person or group acts in a way that catches our attention and challenges our notions about sexual behavior.  Some of those behaviors that have gained attention include polygamy, polyamory or multiple partners, sex outside of marriage, same-sex relations, and sex with underage children.  This class examines the histories, practices, and beliefs of religious groups that caught their neighbor’s attention because the groups engaged in practices that their neighbors found offensive or violated state and federal laws.  Those practices include sexual relations, institution of marriage, organization of family units, and parenting.  Some of the groups that the class will look at include:  Shakers, Oneida Community, Mormon Church (19th century) and Children of God, Peoples Temple, and Branch Davidians (20th century).  The class will examine why those religious groups were attacked by outsiders, why members chose to join or remain with such groups, and how the beliefs and practices of these groups reflected or challenged notions of gender and sexuality.",

These skills are critical to participating in our democracy as an informed citizen, but will also serve you well in your future careers.",

    "description": "This course will explore how and why American slavery begins, expands, becomes a subject of intense social debate and conflict, and finally, how and why slavery comes to an end during the Civil War. We explore the major national developments shaped by slavery, and we also explore the day-to-day experience of everyone whose lives were touched by slavery--women, children, and men who were bought and sold; people, slave and free, who resisted and rebelled against the practice of slavery; people who staked their family's future success on their ability to buy and profit from the purchase of one enslaved person.We begin by exploring the premise that U.S. history, through the aftermath of the Civil War, is at its core the story of slavery. The earliest laws of the American colonies sought to establish a legal practice of slavery; military strategy during the American Revolutionary War attempted to manipulate American investments in slavery; concerns about the rights of slaveholders influenced every major debate over the national constitution; the right to buy and sell other people became a part of how some Americans defined the meaning of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.In the second half of the course, we focus on the experience of enslaved Africans and African Americans, as they forged families and communities, battled for their rights to bodily integrity, created new American cultures, and brought their critique of slavery to the point of rebellion. We explore the impact of slavery on American ideas about race and racial hierarchies, and we consider the development of national conflicts over the practice, morality, and legality of slavery—culminating in the Civil War.  We also explore the memory and popular history of slavery.In addition to assigned readings and occasional homework assignments, course requirements include short, in-class quizzes; take-home midterm and final exams; and an eight-page research paper on a topic relating to the history of slavery in the U.S.",

    "description": "Do women have a history? How is it different from the history we've learned in high school and college textbooks?In this course, we discover what it means to study women's experience in the past.  What do the most important developments in American history look like when we explore them from the perspective of a Maine midwife, an Iowa farm woman, or an enslaved domestic servant? How does our view of the most significant events and developments in American history change when we measure historical importance by what was most important in women's lives?To answer these questions, we study both the familiar and the unfamiliar, such as the history of sexuality, intimacy, and motherhood, as well as the history of women's paid and unpaid work. We will explore how women, as political actors, shaped the outcome of familiar events (the American Revolution, the Civil War), but also how they organized social movements around the important issues of their lives -- such as the abolition of slavery and the right to consent to sexual intimacy. We will consider how women's inequality was established in law and social practice, as well as how women thought about and challenged inequality.Our focus includes the distinct, but interconnected histories of different groups of women -- free and enslaved, southern and northern, indigenous and immigrant, working-class and elite. We will read histories, primary documents like diaries and memoirs, and grapple with the difference between our own experience and the experiences of women in the past.In addition to required readings and occasional homework assignments, course requirements include a short essay assignment, an eight-rage research paper on a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor, and take-home midterm and final exams.",

    "description": "This course provides an in-depth introduction to the life, ideas, and ongoing impact of one of the most influential activists and thinkers of modern times—Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869 - 1948). From his conservative upbringing in a small city in Western India, to his early career as a London-trained lawyer, to his transformative experiences working with Indian laborers in South Africa and then his epochal role in the Indian freedom struggle and self-transformation into a charismatic mahatma (“great soul”)—Gandhi’s fascinating odyssey helped shape some of the 19th and 20th centuries most momentous events, even as his abiding concern for an ethical and embodied politics anticipated social movements and themes that continue to resonate in the 21st century: the pursuit of political and social liberation through non-violent civil disobedience, the assertion of human rights, and the quest for sustainable lifestyles that uphold the common good and protect the natural environment. We will consider the evolution of Gandhi’s thought and activism in historical perspective through selected writings (including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, and his manifesto Hind Swaraj) and will examine his legacy as reflected in a variety of sources and media, including both Western and Indian feature films, the American civil rights movement and South African anti-apartheid struggle, and in critical responses to Gandhi, both positive and negative.",

    "description": "This course challenges students in the health sciences to consider what they must learn in order to apply their professional skills in unfamiliar societies. Taking Africa as an example, it will lead students to think about how knowledge of culture, economies and history can enhance their ability to apply their skills in African nations. The course will use a wide variety of materials, including not only readings by historians and social sciences, but also videos and fiction by African writers. Among the themes to be covered are i) African environments and their challenges to human health, ii) relations between genders and generations in African societies, iii) the historical experience of Africans in precolonial, colonial and post-colonial periods, and iv) the causes and consequences of economic underdevelopment in Africa. In addition, the course will look at the ways in which Africans combine indigenous and biomedical therapies. It will examine healing institutions and conceptions of illness which are very old in Africa, and also the relatively recent development of biomedical health professions. It will also look at the lives of both traditional healers as well as African physicians and nurses. Assignments will deal with practical problems created by cultural unfamiliarity which health professionals might encounter in Africa. Grading will be based on several short writing assignments and class participation. The course instructor, James Giblin, is the co-director of the African Studies Program.",

Our focus is on the changing cultural meanings of disability, rather than its physical or medical aspects, and the emergence in the 20th century of a disability rights movement. We discuss how the meaning of disability changes over time in response to other cultural and intellectual trends, and how these changes affect social policies and practices. We will also examine how the study of disability can illuminate key aspects of American history, such as anti-immigrant movements, the eugenics movement, racial and gender stereotyping, the belief in progress, and the related ideals of the natural and the normal. The readings are eclectic, including social and cultural histories, primary documents, and fictional representations of disability.",

    "description": "Grant Wood, Iowa’s most famous artist, once said that “I realized that all the really good ideas I'd ever had came to me while I was milking a cow. So I went back to Iowa.'\" For Grant Wood, farm life was the seedbed for great ideas.  But another Midwesterner, Bob Dylan, once explained that he left Minnesota because “it couldn’t give me anything.”  In “History of Iowa and the Midwest,” we will examine themes of regionalism, nostalgia, and memory.  To many Americans on the coasts, the Midwest is little more than “flyover country,” and it is often misrepresented as all-white, egalitarian, and unsophisticated.  Designed to be a region free from slavery, and, through state-sponsored violence, largely devoid of Native Americans, America’s founders embraced rural visions of work and democracy.  Their vision of the Middle West has been replaced by urbanization and industrial agriculture.  But throughout its history, the region’s diverse inhabitants have shaped the land, and the culture of the Midwest, in significant ways.Requirements: In the first half of the course, students will be required to write two 3-4 page essays.  The first, “place-based memoir” requires students to write an essay about their hometown.  The second paper, “Nostalgia and Revolt” requires students to explore long-held stereotypes regarding Iowa and the Midwest in the news. The final, cumulative research project (typically a 10-12 page research paper) focuses on the main course themes, from Iowa in film to race relations and rural life.",

    "description": "View introduction video \n\nWorld War II was a major watershed in American history, not only for the obvious fact that it transformed the American role in the world but also for its impact on the \"home front\" as well; students focus on the latter in this course. Any sustained war effort has important political, social, cultural, and economic implications. It shifts the priorities of political life, recasts the economy around wartime needs, and scrambles the private lives of those at home and abroad. All of this was exaggerated in the case of American participation in World War II. The sheer scale of the war effort brought with it far more profound and lasting changes than the shorter and smaller mobilization of 1917-1919. And, perhaps most importantly, the war came in a time at which the basic direction of American politics, political economy, and political culture was \"up for grabs.\" The Depression which had begun in 1929 still gripped the nation's economy, and the political response to the Depression--the New Deal--had transformed the role of the state in the economy, introduced the first hints of the modern welfare state, and changed the rules and expectations of labor relations. All of these changes were matters of fierce debate when the war came; in some respects the war suspended this debate, but in other respects it resolved it by recasting the New Deal around the assumptions of full employment and increased government spending. As students trace this and other elements of the war experience, they touch on prewar patterns, the impact and importance of the war, and the postwar situation. \nNote: this course has proctored online exams.

    "description": "Because the Middle Ages have been the focal point of nationalistic mythmaking in Europe since the early nineteenth century, it is not surprising that, from the earliest days of movies, noted directors have chosen as their subjects both historical medieval events and the great literature of the Middle Ages.  This course is intended to help students appreciate why there is no such thing as “pure” entertainment; to analyse films that purport to represent historical reality or to translate faithfully such medieval epic poems as the Nibelungenlied, instead as primary sources that reveal the culture and temporal moment in which the films’ creators made it.  Beyond augmenting students’ visual literacy, the course will have as its goal developing the tools all historians need to hone: the ability to find the point of view of primary and secondary sources, to recognise how time and culture affect the construction of the past, and how that construction, in turn, shapes particular societies, including our own.",

Though the Middle Ages are generally defined as having definitively ended by1500AD, medieval book-making traditions continue through the early modern era and have amuch wider scope than western Europe. The course, therefore, centers on material from Europe[c. 1200-1600], but will also consider the book-making traditions of Asia, Africa, India and theMiddle East from earlier and later periods. We will discuss book production and use across thecultures of the book and analyze these issues through a global perspective. Students will developthe skills necessary to assess a book’s material evidence in order to analyze historical aspectssuch as book production, patronage, and use. The goal is to combine historical research andphysical analysis of the book in order to gain insight into the history of places, periods andpeople – and to examine how the microhistory presented in an individual book can inform thelarger cultural history of the period. The course is a combination of lecture, discussion and indepthsessions involving the direct study of physical objects. Students complete several shortwriting assignments, a research assignment, and a final project. Final projects may be a researchpaper, a survey of books, or production of a historical model based on a book in the UI SpecialCollections.

    "description": "This course concentrates on Africa south of the Sahara. It surveys the major changes in this region over the 2000 years which preceded the onset of European colonial rule in the late 19th century. Thus it brings the story of African history up to 1880, the point at which European colonialism irrevocably changed the course of African social development. The course focuses on the major dynamics of economic and political change, including the development of states and large systems of trade. A major aspect of this history is the Atlantic slave trade. The course places the slave trade in the wider context of African political, economic and social history, and examines its impact on African societies. The course concludes by discussing the ways in which Africans living under European influence in the early colonial period interpreted their own past.\nThe study of African history has produced a particularly wide variety of views and interpretations.The purpose of this introductory course is to help studentsmake their own judgments about competing claims and conflicting interpretations of the African past. To this end, much of the course is devoted to examining competing interpretations and the evidence on which they are based. It discusses the major arguments which have developed among historians of Africa, and looks at how historians use archaeological, linguistic and documentary evidence. Above all, it discusses historians’ use of African oral tradition. As we will see, one of the most interesting aspects of African historical study is that it draws upon kinds of evidence which are rarely used by historians in other parts of the world, and so gives us an unusual perspective on the human past. Grades are based upon two exams, two writing assignments, and several quizzes.",

Very likely the class will break into two (or more) sections reflecting differences in the nature of students’ writing projects and/or topics and themes. For all students, however, the purpose of the course is to facilitate, enhance, and accelerate the writing process through engagement with a community of peers free from the distractions of readings and papers unrelated to the writing projects. During the semester students will circulate drafts to their classmates (and the instructor) and receive written and oral feedback.",

During the first half (or first ¼) of the semester, I will discuss research and presentation skills (covering such things as plagiarism, reliable sources, organizing a presentation, presentation skills, asking and answering questions, etc.) and I will provide instruction about the history and background of the Revolutionary War. During the second half (or last ¾) of the semester, students will give presentations about notable Revolutionary women whose heroic deeds and bravery helped the U.S. win the war for independence, but whose stories often go untold.\n \nStudents will be paired up, and pairs will be assigned a woman to research. Some notable women that will be included on the list include Sybil Ludington - often called the “Female Paul Revere”, Abigail Adams, Nancy Hart, Esther DeBerdt Reed and the mysterious female spy known only as “Agent 355”. Pairs will be assigned a woman to research, and they must create a 20 minute (more or less) presentation about that woman. Students take notes during the presentations, and ask questions once the presentation is finished. The presentations will be assessed, and the final assessment will include a short comprehensive exam about the various presentations and a short reflective paper about the woman who they felt was most notable.",

    "description": "If you could retire from your job just a few years after college, would you do it? That’s exactly what blogger “Mr. Money Mustache” did; when he was only 30 years old, he quit his engineering job and retired early. His story was picked up by several large media publications (Business Insider, Forbes, New York Mag, etc.), bringing a large amount of popular attention to the “FIRE” (Financially Independent, Retired Early) movement that had existed as a small but vibrant community for several decades. In this class, we will examine the concept of financial independence from two main angles. First, we’ll use it to reflect on our own lives: How do we earn and spend our money? Does that spending make us happy? Would doing something different make our lives better? What would we do if we didn’t have to work for a living? Second, we’ll use it to connect to various academic disciplines: What might economists, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers say about money, work, happiness, and the good life? Students will learn by reading short articles, listening to podcasts, and discussing these in class. Students will expand and demonstrate their learning through short reflective papers and a final poster presentation.",

    "description": "A large wave of Czech immigrants came to the U.S. in the mid-1850s, many of them settling in Iowa. In 1893, the famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorak and his family spent the summer in the northeast Iowa town of Spillville, a town that was settled primarily by Czech immigrants. Spillville and its neighboring town of Protivin, IA, have some of the largest Czech-American populations (by percentage) in the state. Additionally, here in Eastern Iowa, Cedar Rapids has a thriving Czech community and is home to the National Czech and Slovak Museum. Capitalizing on Iowa’s ample Czech heritage, this class aims to introduce students to some of the popular authors of 20th and 21st century Czech literature (English translations), most of which is largely intertwined with Czech history and politics.\n \nWriters to be discussed and explored in the course include (but are not limited to) Milan Kundera, Vaclav Havel, Josef Skvorecky, Zdena Salivarova, Karel Capek, Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Klima, Monika Zgustova, and Bianca Bellova. In addition to class lectures, students will read (independently) a Czech novel of their choosing (from pre-approved selections). This course is an opportunity for students of all backgrounds to strengthen their reading, research, and critical analysis skills, as well as learn about the turbulent Czech history of the 20th century. Students will be assessed via class discussions/participation, short reflection journals, and a final project based on the novel they have read.",

    "description": "Although talk of ghosts and the supernatural was discouraged by Confucius, tales of the dead and their doings abound from earliest times. What is a ghost in traditional Chinese culture? Where do ghosts live? What is the underworld like? How (and why) do ghosts interact with people? Are they friends, lovers, enemies, or simply indifferent? Who is more powerful, humans or ghosts? This course introduces a variety of Chinese ghost stories and tales of the weird from ancient times to 1800. The earliest ones are presented as historical accounts, often intended to teach moral lessons, while the latest are pure fiction, intended to be read for pleasure and entertainment. We will consider questions related to literary form and intent: what is history, what is fiction, and how permeable is the boundary between the real and the fantastic? The major writing assignments for this course will be creative: students will select and rewrite two of the ghost stories we read, perhaps updating the setting to modern times or moving the story from China to Iowa, changing the ending or other plot elements, transforming or adding characters, making a scary story campy or fun, or giving a happy story a tragic ending or vice versa, and write an essay discussing the changes. Other assignments include frequent in-class writing, brief reading response essays, quizzes/reading checks, regular attendance and enthusiastic class participation. This is a discussion-based course and attendance is required.",

Attendance is required at two lectures and one hour of discussion each week.

    "description": "Religious and spiritual healing have been deployed as a major part of medical practice for thousands of years and, conversely, healing has been a major part of religious practice for as long as religion has existed. Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.",

From his conservative upbringing in a small city in Western India, to his early career as a London-trained lawyer, to his transformative experiences working with Indian laborers in South Africa and then his epochal role in the Indian freedom struggle and self-transformation into a charismatic mahatma (“great soul”)—Gandhi’s fascinating odyssey helped shape some of the 19th and 20th centuries most momentous events, even as his abiding concern for an ethical and embodied politics anticipated social movements and themes that continue to resonate in the 21st century: the pursuit of political and social liberation through non-violent civil disobedience, the assertion of human rights, and the quest for sustainable lifestyles that uphold the common good and protect the natural environment. We will consider the evolution of Gandhi’s thought and activism in historical perspective through selected writings (including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, and his manifesto Hind Swaraj) and will examine his legacy as reflected in a variety of sources and media, including both Western and Indian feature films, the American civil rights movement and South African anti-apartheid struggle, and in critical responses to Gandhi, both positive and negative.",

Specifically, this course introduces four legal traditions that become the classification scheme for comparing criminal adjudication processes from arrest through sentencing and corrections. In addition, the course briefly examines the essential characteristics of the American perspective on criminal law. Domestic crime, transnational crime and criminal justice are explored. In additional, the course explores differences and similarities in how juvenile court processes are organized from an international perspective. The course focuses on legal and sociolegal issues that are relevant to policing, court processing and corrections. Throughout the course, comparisons of countries exemplifying the four legal traditions guides development of an international understanding of differences in concepts of justice and the operation of criminal adjudication.\nNote: this course has proctored online exams.

We will then learn about the methods sociologists use to study social problems with a particular focus on how to evaluate statistics about social problems presented by the media, politicians, and activists. In the remainder of the semester we will cover specific social problems, including poverty, racism, gender inequality, family problems, education, and crime, in detail. The lectures, discussions, assignments, and group exercises are designed so that you will understand what a sociological perspective is and be able to apply that perspective to the social problems we cover; gain a greater understanding of each of the social problems we cover and be able to explain causes and consequences of those problems; understand the methods social scientists use to further knowledge about social problems; improve skills that are fundamental to college education including: “numerical literacy” and the ability to think critically about statistics, reading tables, evaluating arguments, pulling together evidence to support a position, and writing with clarity. This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.  Current UI students should register directly on MyUI.  Students who are not admitted to the UI click here to proceed. Contact 319-335-2575 or dce-registration@uiowa.edu for assistance.",

    "description": "This course examines the ways in which we address the major social issues and challenges that we face in the nation, in the state, and in our communities.  We begin with the fundamental and elemental questions: What it is the role of government in a democratic society? How do we decide when, where, and how government acts—in ways that are consistent with our social goals and values? Policy Matters will focus on a selection of our most pressing social issues such as education, inequality, labor standards, and health care.  On each of these topics, we will devote attention to the historical development of the problem or policy in question (both to provide background, and to help students imagine historical alternatives).  We will trace the ways in which we address these social issues and engage students in critically analysis (through evaluation and comparison) of both the effectiveness of current policies and the universe of policy alternatives. And we will examine the ways in which social science contributes to both policy design and policy assessment (How do we know what works?).   The course will be co-taught by Sarah Bruch (Sociology) and Colin Gordon (History), with the participation of other UI faculty (and members of the community) on given topics.",

As part of its focus, sociology investigates and exposes aspects of social life that are usually taken for granted. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender organizes and structures the social world in which we live. To this end, we will be investigating such topics as the predominant theoretical stances related to the study of gender, femininities and masculinities, how gender structures everyday social interaction, and how social institutions (e.g., education, work, family, the media) create gendered meanings and structures. Finally, we will conclude by considering ways to intervene in many of the processes that perpetuate gender-based inequality",

    "description": "This class is about the complex and fascinating relationship between law and society. On the one hand, law is a product of social relations, and, as such, it reflects instrumental and symbolic needs of different groups that develop and use it. In the course of this semester, students will learn different theories about how new laws emerge and evolve over time. Lectures and reading will provide insight about the different ways that social and legal change influence each other.\nAt the same time, law is, in and of itself, a social force that shapes communities that adopt it, generating highly unequal outcomes for different social groups. To examine the effect of law on the lives of ordinary people, this course surveys the reasons why people obey or break the law and examine the theories that explain how people relate to, avoid, or use the law it in their everyday lives. Finally, we will explore the consequences that law has for the distribution of power and social inequality by considering how race, gender, and class impact people’s experiences with legal institutions. In this class, we will explore a number of interesting case studies that link class material to current social issues. For instance, we'll discuss the murder of Trayvon Martin, compare Islamic and Western legal systems, investigate why and when students cheat on exams, and find out what interactional dynamics influence the decisions of juries.\nEach student’s grade for the semester will be based on five factors:\nAttendance and Participation (15%)\nAttendance is mandatory for lectures and discussion sections.\nResearch Exercises (30% total: 2 x 15% each) – Students are required to carry out two exercises that combine in-class group work and individual out-of-class work.  The exercises will combine elements of qualitative data collection (through interviews and ethnography), media analysis, group discussion, and writing. Students will have two weeks to complete the assignments. \nMidterm Exam (25%) - a combination of short-answer questions and essays.\nFinal Exam (30%) –a combination of short-answer questions and essays.",

Many people struggle with teamwork, from students working on class projects to VPs organizing their companies. We will read and compare different perspectives on this question from disciplines like business, healthcare, psychology, engineering, and computer science. The goal is for students to practice their critical reading and discussion skills, while gaining a fresh perspective on teamwork that will improve their experience with team projects in college.\nOur discussions will not be limited only to how people work together; we’ll also talk about how computing devices (laptops, smartphones, Google’s servers, supercomputers) work together. In both cases, the need for a team to communicate slows its progress. How do we cope with this fact?\nIn each class meeting we will have a discussion about an article. Each student will create a summary report of one of these class discussions. Students will be graded on participation in discussions and the quality of their summary report.",

The hardware component of the course begins by introducing the basic switching components of all digital circuits. It next shows how to analyze circuits and also how to build circuits that conform to specified computational properties. It introduces many standard circuits used by all computers, such as logic and shift circuits, arithmetic circuits, and memory circuits. The course then presents the design of a current general-purpose digital computer; class discussions cover the interface between the computer and its external devices. It presents alternatives in computer design, contrasting complex-instruction-set computers (CISCs) with reduced-instruction-set computers (RISCs). The software component of the course introduces assembly language programming. It describes instructions of classes including control-flow, load and store, operate (arithmetic, logical, and shift and rotate), stack, type conversion, privileged, and I/O. The course also describes addressing modes and their utility. The software component concludes by describing software to control hardware devices. Requirements include 8-10 homework assignments and two or three exams. The course is taught by a faculty member.",

Symbolic logic is a powerful tool for modeling computation and computational devices and reasoning formally about them. It provides a unifying foundational framework for several areas of computer science and engineering such as databases, artificial intelligence, hardware design, programming languages, software engineering, and security. This course introduces several logics (propositional, predicate, temporal, modal, ...) differing in their expressive power and focus, and discusses some of their uses in computer science. Main themes are how to represent knowledge in these logics, what represents a valid argument, and how to prove or disprove, possibly automatically, the validity of a logical statement. Two one-hour exams and a final are usually given, plus several written homeworks.",

    "description": "Attempts to understand how social networks evolve and to quantify their characteristics started some fifty years ago. Since then, much work has been done to measure, classify and derive important properties of these networks. These include structural properties like random topology, power-law topology and small-world networks, connectedness, community structure in networks, various centrality measures, and social network analysis. Comparatively, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are a more recent development in Internet information systems. The major focus is to see how a meaningful distributed system can be built by the millions of machines at the edges of the Internet without the help of a distinguished node like a central server. Important applications include file sharing, searching, storage, streaming, multicast, publish-subscribe etc. Topics will include: \nIntroduction to Social and P2P networks  Evolution of Networks: Random graphs, power-law graphs, small-world graphs  Various centrality measures, Communities and Community detection, influence spreading  Historic first generation P2P networks: Napster, Gnutella  Unstructured vs. DHT-based structured networks  KaZaA, Chord, CAN, Pastry, BitTorrent, Kademlia, Skip graph  Self-organization, routing, replication, storage, security, selfishness, etc",

The purpose of formal methods is to enable the construction of large, highly reliable software. Their foundation is the precise specification of the run-time properties that a software system is expected to satisfy. The course presents a collection of techniques for formal software development including operational, algebraic, model-based, property-based specification methods; for the verification of consistency and completeness of specifications; for the verification of software properties. Course work includes exercises in specification construction and verification, both on paper and using formal method-based tools. The course is taught by a faculty member.

Principles explored in this course will be:  The poise of the head in fluid relationship to the spine;  responses to gravity; developing sensory awareness and understanding the process of change;  conscious use of of energy and direction to support natural phrasing; \"body mapping\" and experiential anatomy to clarify how movement takes place most easily. Physical participation in this studio course will include lying down, rolling, sitting, standing, locomotion and your skilled activity.  Alexander Technique is most often taught through light touch, thinking and visualization:  Students will learn some principles of listening to information from their hands through touch, and how to learn through the kinesthetic information supplied by touch.  Work outside of class time will include a journal, observations, and take-home questions.  Students will be expected to practice daily and explore the use of the principles learned with their specific performance area or in service of other unique goals.",

    "description": "Collaborative Performance has been created through the Department of Dance to bring together dance artists and advanced practitioners from varied disciplines for the purpose of creating an environment for artistic collaboration, culminating in a devised “dance” performance. Each student will contribute their expertise to the process of investigating: artistic intent and how that intent can be revealed through dance and the various arts represented in the class; the personal visions of a choreographer, director, writer, or other lead artist and how that can integrate with others’ creativity in a coherent, focused, collaborative whole; experimenting, communicating, and discovering the different artistic languages we speak across disciplines. We will strive to discover what makes collaboration successful in multiple contexts and what our arts have in common, all in the process of creating collaborative work. Participation in class discussions and exercises is required. Activities will include presentations, work sharing, discussion of assigned study materials, and performance studies. Grades will be based on participation, creative and/or technical contribution to the final project, and a reflection paper on collaborative performance principles and practical issues.\n \nStudents registering for the 4 s.h. option will have additional hours in the theatre and rehearsals outside of class.",

Aesthetic clarity and skillfully crafted dances are expected.  The performance project should demonstrate artistry in technique and expression as well as insight into the interpretive art.  A range of performance expression should be evident.  The Thesis, whether a choreography thesis or a performance thesis, is considered to be the comprehensive outgrowth of the student's graduate studies at The University of Iowa.  It should be designed to facilitate an extensive period of research and rehearsal, leading to the final performances showcased in a formal concert setting.  Necessary elements of the project include the selection of a thesis committee.  If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.",

    "description": "Successful people plan, they know who they are and they excel at putting themselves in situations that take advantage of all they have to offer, often making success look easy. Managing yourself starts with knowing yourself and your unique talents. This course will focus in part on getting to know who you are at your core. Being clear about what your strengths and goals are, what motivates you, and knowing your learning style provide the foundation for effectively managing yourself in a variety of situations. Once we have uncovered some of your key attributes we will analyze how that information can best be applied to manage yourself toward greater effectiveness in achieving your goals and being successful in areas that are truly important to you. Topics include (but are not limited to) assessing your strengths, setting goals, self-control, personal finance, effective habits, communication, leadership, and mindfulness. If you want to learn to be more effective at achieving more of the goals that are important to you this course is for you. Grades in the course will be based on participation in discussion, self-assessments, reflection papers, and a final paper and class presentation. This course is intended for students from all disciplines but will be of particular interest to Management majors.",

    "description": "Fill in the blank: “The role of business is to…” If you are like most people, you would probably choose something like “make money” or “create wealth for its owners”. But, if you are like most people, you will not stop here; you would probably include other things such as: “make money for its owners… while protecting customers, treating employees with respect, and creating value for society at large.” As Henry Ford famously said: “The purpose of the [Ford] company is to do as much possible for everybody concerned… Business is a service, not a bonanza.” Indeed, only sociopaths such as Bernie Madoff would state that “the role of business is to make money for their owners –period.” Since the early 2000s, a growing number of companies have been in the news because of various scandals. Companies accused of committing violations of the public trust include Enron, Martha Stewart, British Petroleum, Boeing, Volkswagen, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers,  and many others. Serious questions are raised constantly about ongoing day-to-day business issues: environmental pollution, corporate governance, ethical conduct, executive compensation, government involvement, health issues, international corruption, reduced health insurance benefits, moving offshore, etc. This list illustrates the enduring tensions between business and society. This course will examine the relationships between business and society in the context of the United States. The course will address the following fundamental questions: What is the role of government in the socioeconomic system? What are firms’ social responsibilities? What is the role of ethics for business management? What responsibilities companies have to consumers, employees, shareholders, and communities? We will read short assignments (3-7 pages) each week and discuss various concepts related to business and society. We will also watch short videos and discuss specific cases of “the good, the bad, and the ugly”: companies that have been either leaders or laggards in corporate social responsibility.",

    "description": "This course offers students a broad overview of the role nonprofit organizations play in building and enhancing local communities. Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations. Students will be graded on discussion forums, short writing assignments, and a final strategic plan.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "This course offers students a broad overview of the role nonprofit organizations play in building and enhancing local communities. Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations. Students will be graded on discussion forums, short writing assignments, and a final strategic plan.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "“It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” —Albert Einstein This class is designed to prepare you for a life of writing in the health professions. Efficiency in written communication will be our primary goal. The above quote (sometimes called ‘Einstein’s Razor,’ as it can be read as a counter/complement to Occam’s Razor), is often paraphrased and/or misattributed as, “Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.” Curiously, Einstein didn’t follow his own advice when writing his statement. When we write, however, we will always strive to do so. Along the way you will also either learn or augment the following skills: reading comprehension, rhetorical analysis, peer feedback, editing/proofreading.  As this may be the last writing course you ever take, the intention is to give you as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The semester is broken down into three parts, each focused on writing for specific audiences you will encounter throughout your career, namely: the professional, the public, and the scientific. At the end of the course you will have compiled a portfolio of material that is immediately applicable to the next stage of your professional development.  In the first segment we will cover professional communications and official correspondence, with a focus on job and graduate applications materials (resumes, CVs, personal statements, cover letters, etc.). The second segment will cover science writing for a general audience, in other words, how to communicate what you know about the science world to those who do not share your expertise. Whether the goal is to persuade, inform, support, or refute, the necessary rhetorical elements will be addressed and reinforced. Specific techniques will be taught where needed such as formatting, supporting an argument, or creating a narrative structure for a personal essay, op eds, or article of interest. Finally, the third segment will concentrate on reading and writing in the hard sciences. We will read articles and studies such as those found in Lancet, Science, or the NEJM to break them down for content and structure, and we will develop our own original material in the form of reviews, summations, and critique. Special attention will be paid to methods of gathering, outlining, and drafting information that either illuminates and/or argues a particular case. A classic Writers’ Workshop structure will be employed, allowing authors to gain and offer written feedback throughout the semester. This course has neither tests nor quizzes. Attendance is required.",

This introductory-level course introduces key cultural and social influences on sickness and healing, illustrating with examples from throughout the globe and across the different subfields of anthropology. Sometimes called “the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities,” anthropology offers well-developed concepts and numerous case studies that help to improve cross-cultural understanding of the social and biological foundations of human health. This course also emphasizes the development of critical reading skills that students need in order to best understand works from the medical social sciences and humanities.",

It is also for those who want to understand the growing religious diversity of America’s communities and the impact that religion and spirituality can have on people’s ways of confronting matters of life and death.  The central goal of the course is to help you prepare for life and work in contexts where ethical, religious, and spiritual questions simply cannot be avoided and ought to be treated with intelligence and sensitivity.\nThe course utilizes virtual reality software (OSGrid and Firefox) in order to transform what can seem like abstract cases into personal encounters within the context of a Virtual Clinic. Using this software requires no prior experience, and the course includes ample instruction. Neuropsychologists have established that good ethical decision-making requires the engagement, not only of the intellect, but also of the emotions. The intent of this course is to therefore to engage your mind, imagination, and emotions.

Although a variety of infectious agents will be considered, the emphasis will be on those that cause serious mortality and morbidity in humans today. For each of the major classes of pathogen – viruses, bacteria and pathogenic eukaryotes – we will learn how genetic variation is generated, how the spread of these pathogens can be reconstructed using phylogenetic and other evolutionary techniques, and how they are able to evade host immune responses and cause disease in humans. Special emphasis will be given to new, emerging diseases, such as HIV and swine-origin influenza virus, and the evolutionary forces that allow these pathogens to jump into and establish themselves in modern human populations.",

    "description": "Engaging in Global Health...how do you start, how can you become a participant in promoting health throughout the world? The United Nations Millennium Declaration, signed in 2000, commits world leaders to promote global health through combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and discrimination against women.\nAre you planning on becoming an educator, an engineer or lawyer? Or perhaps a dietician, political scientist or social activist? How can these professions participate in promoting global health? There are many ways to get involved in the cause of global health, and this course will show you how. What can you do while you are still in school? What career opportunities are available in global health?\nDuring this workshop, students will hear from both student peers and global health professionals, as they share their experiences in global health. Students will gain an understanding of how professionals and volunteers work in a broad variety of settings. Discussions will include experiences of working with government-based programs, international organizations like UNICEF or World Vision, health care agencies, faith-based organizations, industry, and academic institutions. At the conclusion of this course, students will know a variety of ways to become engaged, to get involved in global health!\nEvaluation and grades will be based on attendance, participation, and on a short essay due ten days after the end of the workshop.",

    "description": "Religious and spiritual healing have been deployed as a major part of medical practice for thousands of years and, conversely, healing has been a major part of religious practice for as long as religion has existed. Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.",

Taking Africa as an example, it will lead students to think about how knowledge of culture, economies and history can enhance their ability to apply their skills in African nations. The course will use a wide variety of materials, including not only readings by historians and social sciences, but also videos and fiction by African writers. Among the themes to be covered are i) African environments and their challenges to human health, ii) relations between genders and generations in African societies, iii) the historical experience of Africans in precolonial, colonial and post-colonial periods, and iv) the causes and consequences of economic underdevelopment in Africa. In addition, the course will look at the ways in which Africans combine indigenous and biomedical therapies. It will examine healing institutions and conceptions of illness which are very old in Africa, and also the relatively recent development of biomedical health professions. It will also look at the lives of both traditional healers as well as African physicians and nurses. Assignments will deal with practical problems created by cultural unfamiliarity which health professionals might encounter in Africa. Grading will be based on several short writing assignments and class participation. The course instructor, James Giblin, is the co-director of the African Studies Program.",

    "description": "In Creativity for a Lifetime, students will learn the significance of creativity in human happiness and success. Creativity is part of what makes us human, and understanding the creative process is relevant to all of us. In this course, we will examine questions about big ideas, such as: What is creativity and how can we be more creative? What can we learn from closely examining our own and others’ creative work? What is the role of creativity across the human lifespan? How can creative work be a part of healthy adult life and healthy aging? We will especially consider the lives and work of artists. Because artists intensively imagine things that don’t yet exist, understanding artist’s experiences will enhance innovation and imagination. Students in the arts, liberal arts, sciences, and social sciences can apply the experience gained from studying the outcomes of creativity and working with established artists to other academic disciplines.\nStudents will engage in activities and projects as opposed to lectures and exams. Taught in an active-learning TILE classroom, Creativity for a Lifetime brings together the knowledge, skills, and life experiences of students and faculty members interested in an array of disciplines, including art and art history, anthropology, education, rhetoric, social work, aging studies, and the health sciences. To better appreciate the elements of successful aging, the richness of life-long learning, and an appreciation of the role of creative endeavor throughout a lifespan, students will meet Iowa artists and collect their oral histories.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

That’s exactly what blogger “Mr. Money Mustache” did; when he was only 30 years old, he quit his engineering job and retired early. His story was picked up by several large media publications (Business Insider, Forbes, New York Mag, etc.), bringing a large amount of popular attention to the “FIRE” (Financially Independent, Retired Early) movement that had existed as a small but vibrant community for several decades. In this class, we will examine the concept of financial independence from two main angles. First, we’ll use it to reflect on our own lives: How do we earn and spend our money? Does that spending make us happy? Would doing something different make our lives better? What would we do if we didn’t have to work for a living? Second, we’ll use it to connect to various academic disciplines: What might economists, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers say about money, work, happiness, and the good life? Students will learn by reading short articles, listening to podcasts, and discussing these in class. Students will expand and demonstrate their learning through short reflective papers and a final poster presentation.",

    "description": "A large wave of Czech immigrants came to the U.S. in the mid-1850s, many of them settling in Iowa. In 1893, the famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorak and his family spent the summer in the northeast Iowa town of Spillville, a town that was settled primarily by Czech immigrants. Spillville and its neighboring town of Protivin, IA, have some of the largest Czech-American populations (by percentage) in the state. Additionally, here in Eastern Iowa, Cedar Rapids has a thriving Czech community and is home to the National Czech and Slovak Museum. Capitalizing on Iowa’s ample Czech heritage, this class aims to introduce students to some of the popular authors of 20th and 21st century Czech literature (English translations), most of which is largely intertwined with Czech history and politics.\n \nWriters to be discussed and explored in the course include (but are not limited to) Milan Kundera, Vaclav Havel, Josef Skvorecky, Zdena Salivarova, Karel Capek, Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Klima, Monika Zgustova, and Bianca Bellova. In addition to class lectures, students will read (independently) a Czech novel of their choosing (from pre-approved selections). This course is an opportunity for students of all backgrounds to strengthen their reading, research, and critical analysis skills, as well as learn about the turbulent Czech history of the 20th century. Students will be assessed via class discussions/participation, short reflection journals, and a final project based on the novel they have read.",

    "description": "University students often view college as a means to an end: earn a degree to get a job. But shouldn’t it be more? The class will examine how interests and talents can be paired up to achieve a fulfilling life. Questions addressed will include:\n\nHow can you identify what you’re good at?\nHow can you build a life of purpose and meaning?\nHow do personal, social, and cultural constraints keep people from finding their passions?\nHow can you cultivate mentors? What is the relationship between ambition, drive, and success?\nHow do parents, peers, and personal temperament shape an individual’s development?\nWhat major might be the best fit, and how can University resources help your academic and personal success?\n\nThe course draws upon the work of well-known psychologists, motivational speakers and sociologists. The class will discuss the writings of Richard Florida, author of “The Rise of the Creative Class,” Daniel Goleman, author of “Emotional Intelligence,” Daniel Pink, author of “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,” and several other prominent thinkers. Students will be required to complete a portfolio of reflective exercises, activities, and journal assignments.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

The first section is a general introduction to abnormal psychology and major theories of psychopathology, diagnostic classification, and ethical issues and research methodology in clinical psychology. The second section concerns psychological testing, including intelligence, personality, and diagnostic and behavioral assessment. Emphasis is placed on how tests are constructed and validated, and on the ethical use of assessment procedures. The third section concerns treatments for psychological disorders. Theory and research for major treatment approaches are presented and film examples of psychotherapy are shown. Discussions are designed to help students integrate empirical literature with specific examples from audiovisual material and specific assignments.  Readings are primarily taken from a text, but additional readings and class materials may be assigned.",

    "description": "This course offers students a broad overview of the role nonprofit organizations play in building and enhancing local communities. Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations. Students will be graded on discussion forums, short writing assignments, and a final strategic plan.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

In addition to weekly one-on-one meetings, students will have the opportunity to participate in group activities at the assisted living center. In addition to attending the orientation sessions, students will submit a short weekly reflection about their experience (through ICON) and will participate in online discussions for class credit. There are two mandatory orientation sessions for this class. One is an orientation to the class and a review of the course outline, and the other is an orientation to the assisted living facility.  Students are required to attend both.  If the meeting times don't work for the student, the student must schedule a private orientation with the  teaching assistant, before being allowed to proceed with the class. Class orientation:  Friday August 25th  at 1 pm in Room 207 North Hall   OR  Monday August 28th at 4 pm in Room 207 North Hall.

    "description": "How language actually works is fascinating.  \nThis course will fascinate by explaining and illustrating the basic grammatical rules of (standard written) English concerning parts of speech, phrases, clauses, sentences and sentence elements. We use the term “grammar” to mean the system of structural rules which describes how words combine with each other to form sentences. In this sense, native speakers of English already have an instinctive knowledge of its grammar. However, the study of language enables us to externalize and formalize this instinctive knowledge and thus can help us to communicate more effectively. Quite simply, if we know how English works, then we can make better use of it. In short, the study of grammar enables us to go beyond our instinctive, native-speaker knowledge, and to use English in an intelligent, informed way.\nEvaluation will consist of regular homework assignments, two in-class exams, and a cumulative final exam.\n \n \nThis course is a Core Course for the Undergraduate Certificate in Writing.",

    "description": "Officially an introduction to sociolinguistics, this course looks at how people use language when they interact with each other. The focus is on dialects of English. You will learn how your way of speaking is different from the way they speak English in, for example, Chicago, Minnesota, Texas, Kentucky, the Boston area, and the east coast states, as well as in England. You will be able, among other things, to characterize the differences between Standard American English and Received Pronunciation, the dialect spoken by the Queen of England.\nFurther, you will discover why you do not understand the earlier forms of English, for example, the English spoken by Geoffrey Chaucer, a 14th century English poet. It will become clear why English spelling is so hard to learn.\nWe will also look at how you vary your language depending on the situation you are in and who you talk to. You will also see how the use of language can tell you about social classes.\nThe course comprises two lectures and one section meeting per week. New content is introduced in the lecture. The section provides an opportunity to enhance your analytical skills. The lecture is taught in an interactive way, whereby the students who wish to work with the instructor provide the data by, for example, pronouncing certain words that are then analyzed in the lecture. The emphasis is on what we do in class, not on the readings.\nCourse requirements include short homework assignments, two midterms, and a final.",

We explore how language rights are integral to human rights in general and an individual's definition of personal and cultural identity through studying a variety of case studies of the abrogation of language rights locally, nationally, and internationally.

Other creatures also think, though not so well as people, but they don’t talk.  These two facts—that only people talk and that people think better than other creatures—are related facts. This course is about why and how these facts are related.\nThe kind of thinking we study in the course is called reasoning: transitions in thought where some thoughts (or beliefs) provide the grounds for arriving at other thoughts (or beliefs).  Our central question is this:\nWhy and how does having the ability to talk improve the ability to reason?\nOur answer to this question has two parts: (1) understanding that “having the ability to talk” requires “knowing a language” (including Sign languages that aren’t spoken) and (2) uncovering (some of) what we know when we know a language. We use set theory to develop a formal model that uncovers the parts of language that help to explain human reasoning abilities.\nUsing the set theoretic formal system, students do proofs of arguments that have long been studied (syllogisms), and we also analyze other reasoning patterns and language phenomena. Ultimately, we discover that an appropriately developed formal system provides us with a remarkable tool for our explicitly thinking and talking about our talking and thinking.",

    "description": "There are an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 living languages in the world. Despite the dizzying number of languages and the fact that they can appear to be extremely different from one another, when viewed through the right lens, there are some remarkable similarities lurking below the surface. \nThe main goal of the course is to look at both of those sides of languages and seek answers to two seemingly very simple questions: How are languages alike and how are they different? In order to get at answers to those questions, we will survey the diverse forms that human languages may take, and examine some of the underlying similarities.  Approaching such a variety of human languages also necessitates developing a vocabulary equal to the task. This vocabulary will indeed allow us to capture the surprisingly small number of ways that languages can differ and how they are alike. We will also survey less technical topics such as writing systems, social registers, and others. No prior experience in linguistics is required for the course, simply an interest in languages and a willingness to work.",

Possible research topics include the phonetics of personal identity (using experimental techniques and analysis to explore the question of whether there are acoustic markers of gender, sexuality, and/or race that are present in speech) and the phonetics and phonology of foreign accent. Coursework will include several homework assignments, critical summaries of course readings, and a final project.",

    "description": "Previous linguistic experience is not necessary.This course is a Core Course for the Writing Certificate.We look at the history of English from two perspectives: external history and internal history. External history deals with non-linguistic events that played a role in the shaping of the English language. Internal history deals with the changes in the grammar (pronunciation, word classes, sentence structure, and vocabulary).You can learn much history through language. For example, the phrase Johnson County Sheriff is loaded with history. Johnson bears testimony to a Danish occupation of England in the 9th century. County, a French word meaning ‘territory ruled by a count or viscount’, goes back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Sheriff is a truly English word, or rather words, because it comes from shire reeve, a royal administrator of a shire, under Alfred the Great in the 9th century. Shires were replaced by counties by the Normans, but the word still survives in names, for example, (New) Hampshire.We also look at texts and analyze them. You will learn how to read Old English sentences, recite Chaucer in Middle English and read Shakespeare with a 17th century accent. You will discover the reasons why English spelling is irrationally hard; for example, you will understand why the spelling Haus in German makes sense while the spelling house in English does not make sense.Requirements: short homework assignments, two midterm exams and a final exam.Required reading: course pack materials prepared by the instructor.Optional readings: papers on ICON and C. M. Millward (1996), A Biography of the English Language. Boston: Thomson.",

Such ideas will include: the ideal of liberty, the American Dream, consumer rights, and the belief in America’s role overseas. We will explore how these ideas emerged, and how they have been conveyed through political documents, paintings, novels, letters, memoirs, photographs, cartoons, films, television shows, popular songs, etc. As this subject is so broad, we will focus on a particular theme: the various journeys Americans have taken in the past and present – whether as slaves, immigrants, and American Indians, or as soldiers, tourists, traveling salesmen, hobos, or protestors. And we will examine how writers, film-makers, artists, and blues or folk singers have expressed their ideals and longings through stories about travel.\nObjectives and Goals of the Course:\n1) To understand that there has been no single \"American experience”; that conditions have varied widely for different groups of Americans.\n2) To gain a sense of how supposedly unchanging and uniquely American ideals such as liberty, equality, mobility, consumer rights, or \"family values\" have had a complex history; that they have had different meanings for different groups and periods in US history.\n3) to learn how to analyze and interpret a variety of cultural sources, including images, monuments, songs, movies, and artifacts.\n \n The courses in this category are eligible for Courses In Common Options",

The class persistently investigates an apparent contradiction: why and how have acts and desires typically valued as highly personal and private (our \"sex lives\") been consistently made available to a mass public through popular, commercial media in modern America? Emphasizing the intertwined fascination with heterosexuality and homosexuality in mass media since the publication of the infamous Kinsey Reports just after WWII, this class considers popular responses to and representations of (among other events): the contradictory sexual discourses of the Cold War era, the “sexual revolution” and the rise of the women’s liberation movement, gay liberation and “queer” activism, and recent manifestations of “post-feminist” ideologies.  Readings for the course include a wide range of primary materials in various genres (fiction, drama, memoir, journalism, etc.) as well as retrospective historical and cultural studies. Students are required to attend two weekly (heavily illustrated) lectures by the course instructor and one weekly discussion section led by a teaching assistant. Course requirements include a series of short essays and response papers, a midterm and final exam, and regular attendance and participation (in discussion sections).",

    "description": "Americans are patriotically proud of their democratic prerogative--the ability of the people to choose their own representatives, and to hold them accountable for their actions on our behalf. At the same time, we revel in the ability to mock those representatives, and even to scoff at the supposedly \"sacred\" democratic process by which they are chosen.\nFrom the Daily Show to the cover of The New Yorker, from presidential candidates trading quips with David Letterman to comedian Al Franken running for U.S. Senate, politically-themed humor has never been more pervasive. This course will go behind the punchlines to examine the historical roots and persistent themes of America's political humor. Drawing on a bit of humor theory and a broad array of examples, from the Revolutionary War era to the present, we will explore the ways in which political laughter both reflects and influences American attitudes regarding government institutions, elected officials, and the democratic process.\nThis course has online proctored examinations.

    "description": "Vacations are more serious events than you might think. One hundred years ago a vacation might have been beyond your grasp – now we take them for granted. This course explores how the vacation has changed from an activity exclusive to the upper classes – the “leisure” class – to an expectation shared by all Americans.\nIn this class we will visit a variety of American vacation sites: our first popular vacation destination, Niagara Falls; resorts for the wealthy such as Newport, Rhode Island, and resorts for the middle class such as Atlantic City; the Jewish resorts of the Catskills and African American resorts such as Idlewild and Sag Harbor; historic sites such as Gettysburg; amusement parks like Coney Island; theme parks like Disneyland; the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 and the Iowa State Fair; the national parks of the American west, and the great middle class family vacation tradition – the road trip. We will learn about these places and their meanings in the American imagination by reading memoirs of famous American vacationers from Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman and Mary Roberts Rinehart to Henry Miller, Jamaica Kincaid and Colson Whitehead.\nThe main project for the semester is to explore the vacation memoirs of your own family and place them within the context of the broader patterns of American vacations throughout history. During the semester you will write up your own recollections and interview your parents and grandparents about their experiences. Grades will be based on a midterm and final exam, the vacation memoir project consisting of three intermediary reports and the final paper, and active discussion throughout the semester.",

    "description": "What do sport films tell us about sport and what do they reveal about our culture at large? Taking sport films as a distinct category of films, this class explores the themes and characters most common to sport films and asks what happens when films diverge from our expectations. We will view each film in terms of the stories it tells, the values it appears to promote, the historical contexts it references (both sport and society more generally), and the ways different aspects of filmmaking influence our viewing experience.  \nWe will screen 15 films over the course of the semester, selecting from classics such as Rocky, Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, and A League of their Own and from more complicated films like Raging Bull, Girlfight, and Big Fan. We will see one film each week, preceded by a lecture that introduces the film and draws connections between the film and the assigned readings. Most weeks, students write a two-page review of the film; some weeks students write a review comparing two films. There are no exams. Grades will be determined by the film reviews, active participation in discussion sections, and a final paper which compares one film screened in class with two other films of the student’s choosing.",

    "description": "Baseball is one of the most enduringly popular cultural activities in US life. Since the late 19th century, baseball has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand “America.” By taking baseball seriously as a cultural practice, we can better understand how and why it has shaped and been shaped by broader cultural forces of which it is a part. We will pursue this aim by examining how the practice has been constructed and to understand it as a site of struggles to define American life. In this course, we will consider the theme of cultural struggle by focusing on the following questions: Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from baseball’s past been remembered and re-imagined? What is considered scandalous and why? What has success in baseball been defined and redefined? The assignments for the course are designed to improve and refine your ability to think carefully about baseball as culture and to communicate your ideas clearly.",

    "description": "This course is designed to help you improve your international literacy. The objectives of this course are to help you develop a functional understanding of global institutions and patterns, to engage you with a variety of international issues and problems, and above all to challenge you to think about the world in new and creative ways that should prove useful in pursuit of career goals with international dimensions. The course is structured around three global challenges: membership in the global community, migration and inequality.\nComplex problems require multifaceted solutions which transcend international boundaries and reach multiple populations across the globe all at once. By applying an International Studies approach to these three global challenges, you will begin to appreciate how taking an interdisciplinary approach is becoming not only increasingly relevant, but indispensable. This class consists of two weekly lectures and a discussion session; you are expected to have read the required readings before each session.

The world is full of both endless possibilities and significant power differentials. Thus, we will consider how we might further develop cultural competencies on personal, organizational and team levels.  We will challenge and support each other as we seek to find answers to the question, “How can I “do good” better?”\nThe course objectives include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nDeveloping a deeper understanding of oneself as a cultural being, with multiple cultural identities.\nThinking critically about how your identity influences you and your perceptions, other’s perceptions of you, and perhaps most importantly, the work you do and actions you take? \nApplying the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) and the Intercultural Conflicts Style Inventory (ICSI) in a variety of circumstances.\nUnderstanding the impact of globalization, both positive and negative, on yourself, others, and the world as a whole.\nExploring what it means to be a globally competent and/or a globally-ready college graduate.  What types of skills, knowledge and mindsets are typically the most useful, and sought after by students and employers? Why?\n\nGrading will be based on reflection papers, class participation, a final presentation, and a midterm and final exam.",

    "description": "Our journey into the modern era begins with a survey of the wide diversity of human societies as they had developed up to the era of global connections and European conquest, starting in the fifteenth century, and an overview of what the world looked like and how international connections were organized in the sixteenth century. We shall endeavor to understand how non-European societies were affected by their encounters with Europe, including how colonization was resisted and how the later spread of capitalism and industrialization re-shaped the fabric of vastly different societies. Our journey concludes with an examination of the first and second world wars, looking at their impacts across the globe. A predominant theme will be how imperialism drew nearly all of the world's diverse peoples into its orbit, culminating in the vast destruction of the Second World War, which in turn undid both the European and the Japanese imperial projects. Grading is based upon participation, a presentation and essay on a topic outside Europe and/or North America, a mid-term and a final exam.",

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to prepare students to complete a proposal for international research in a variety of fields. The course will help students develop topics which are intellectually challenging and personally engaging. Students will study the major components of the research process.\nBy the end of this eight-week course students will create a well-informed, coherent, researchable and personally compelling proposal. Every academic discipline (international studies, history, political science, anthropology, and so on) has its own particular approach to research. This course will discuss generic research issues which are relevant for all disciplines, like the importance of limiting the scope of one’s study and practical methodological considerations that are relevant for ALL disciplines, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH DISCIPLINE HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVES ON THE RESEARCH PROCESS. Students are encouraged to talk to faculty research mentors about the specific research methods of their disciplines.\nI have found that students most readily learn research concepts when they are presented in the context of concrete examples of research. Therefore, the sooner we can begin examining the specifics of YOUR individual studies, the more progress we can make. Other research examples in the course will come from the instructor’s experience in Thailand.\nThis practical approach places the responsibility on students to come up with workable research ideas. Your topic must be international in scope and must utilize your background in your emphasis area.\nThe instructor of this course have high expectations in terms of the quality of the work turned in by the students, in terms of sentence structure, logic and sophistication of arguments, choice of vocabulary, and so on. Of course, all university regulations and procedures will be followed in this course, including regulations on plagiarism, which will be reviewed during the first class period. Your topic must be original, but it should be related to previous research work in the field. Please type all assignments.\nStudents with current or prior enrollment in IS:4990 should not register for this course.",

    "description": "Economics of religion is a thriving field of study that examines socio- economic theories and methods to explain the religious behavioral patterns of individuals, groups or cultures and the social consequences of such behavior. Religious economics is a related subject sometimes conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious principles to evaluate economic perspectives and practices. In Economics of Religion, we will draw on these and other emerging areas of inquiry to explore the origins and functions of religious economic ideas in Islamic, Christian, and Jewish societies throughout history.\n \nSpecifically, after the financial crisis of 2008, scholars paid more attention to the role of religion in sustaining economic development and inspiring financial institutions to offer religion-compliant products and services. Limits on interest-based loans to the growing Muslim community in Western societies forced many banking and investment organization to create shari`a-compliant products and services. The success of Islamist governments in Turkey and Iran to create thriving middle and entrepreneurial classes brought to focus the relationship between religious belief and economics. Globalization, too, played a significant role in raising the profile of religion-inspired financial endeavors, services, and products. Students will be introduced to these and related themes in this highly multidisciplinary course.\n \nThis course is about the origins, functions and impact of Islamic and other religions' ideas and practices in the realms of economic development, financial services and products, business ethics and practices, and business models. Students will explore the ways such ideas and practices affect legacy issues like property rights, poverty, and access to healthcare, education, and social security. Lastly, students will examine the impact of religious ideas and practices on social justice matters that touch on individual and group identity along class, gender, ethnicity, and race, as well as, the role of religion in formulating public policy and directing international relations.

Taking Africa as an example, it will lead students to think about how knowledge of culture, economies and history can enhance their ability to apply their skills in African nations. The course will use a wide variety of materials, including not only readings by historians and social sciences, but also videos and fiction by African writers. Among the themes to be covered are i) African environments and their challenges to human health, ii) relations between genders and generations in African societies, iii) the historical experience of Africans in precolonial, colonial and post-colonial periods, and iv) the causes and consequences of economic underdevelopment in Africa. In addition, the course will look at the ways in which Africans combine indigenous and biomedical therapies. It will examine healing institutions and conceptions of illness which are very old in Africa, and also the relatively recent development of biomedical health professions. It will also look at the lives of both traditional healers as well as African physicians and nurses. Assignments will deal with practical problems created by cultural unfamiliarity which health professionals might encounter in Africa. Grading will be based on several short writing assignments and class participation. The course instructor, James Giblin, is the co-director of the African Studies Program.",

Habits such as attending readings, submitting to literary journals, using appropriate workshop etiquette, and researching the lives of published authors who study/studied at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop (IWW) will be honed. These habits create great students who know about the resources in their community, can apply techniques to revise papers, find appropriate venues for publication, and provide/receive feedback to/from peers. \nStudents will be evaluated on short pieces of written work including a statement of purpose and revision (15%), one creative work (20%), and a paper comparing and contrasting two public readings given by published authors (20%). Evaluated presentations will include a book and author report (15%), and a public reading given at the University of Iowa Library’s Learning Commons. (10%). Participation is worth 20% of the final grade.   \nEach student will be expected to choose and read one book by an author who attended the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.

This course is aimed at developing the critical thinking skills necessary to do well at the college level through analysis of resistance songs written by women — ranging from the 90’s riot grrrl movement to today’s mainstream pop, hip-hop, and country. Women’s resistance songs are not new, however, since the riot grrrl movement in the 90’s they’ve enjoyed broach reach in our culture. These songs, as well as the responses to them, provide rich material to introduce you to active reading, analysis of a text, and speaking skills.\nThis course will teach you how to analyze and respond to texts that are both familiar and socially relevant. Analyzing songs of resistance, we will practice and develop valuable reading, writing, and speaking strategies. For example, as you explore songs like Beyoncé’s “Formation,” you will learn to annotate a text, dig beneath the surface, and articulate your findings for an audience.\nIn addition to analyzing songs, students will read articles, watch documentaries, and look at DIY activities to support our reading. Students will craft shorts responses to the texts and documentaries, as well as perform presentations to develop confidence when speaking.",

    "description": "In the 21st century, protestors take to cyberspace as well to the streets. Movements such as Black Lives Matter, The Women’s March, and Occupy have all employed social media and online communications tools to organize political action, spread awareness about social issues, and pursue social justice. Elsewhere, technically-savvy “hacktivists” have used computer hacking for political protest and digital whistleblowers have used the net to bring light to potential abuses of corporate or political power.\nBy looking at and discussing histories and primary sources (in forms spanning from print to tweet to interactive media), this course will look at the history of hacktivism and online political activism. We will explore hacking’s roots in the counterculture of the 1960’s. We will read hacker manifestos, learn about early political hacks, such as the “Worms Against Nuclear Killers” attack on NASA, and see how the internet became a free speech battleground. Closer to the present, the course will look at recent hacktivist organizations and actions, such as Anonymous and its Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, as well as the roles hacktivists have played in events such as the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. We will see how social media tools are employed by groups such as Black Lives Matter, while also considering how digital media have been used as tools of harassment. We will also look at how computer hacking might endanger national security or even democracy in the 21st century. In doing all this, students will learn both about the strategies and tactics behind hacktivism, and how online political movements reflect the increasingly digital nature of life.",

More importantly, what impact have these movies had on Iowa’s reputation as well as its economy?\nIn this course we will be analyzing clips from more than a dozen movies set in Iowa and considering the verbal and visual messages that they have sent about this state and its people. The film clips will complement short readings and in-class activities which will focus on different time periods or themes each week. For example we will witness the impact of major events such as the Great Depression and World War II, and we will explore the films’ treatment of gender, race, and ethnicity issues. Featured films will include State Fair, The Music Man, Field of Dreams, The Bridges of Madison County, Cedar Rapids, and more.\nThroughout this course students will be expected to improve their ability to think critically and write at a college-level, as well as gain confidence in small-group discussions. Students will also be introduced to the concepts of visual rhetoric, basic film analysis, and cultural criticism. Grades will be based on class participation and four short writing assignments.",

    "description": "In Creativity for a Lifetime, students will learn the significance of creativity in human happiness and success. Creativity is part of what makes us human, and understanding the creative process is relevant to all of us. In this course, we will examine questions about big ideas, such as: What is creativity and how can we be more creative? What can we learn from closely examining our own and others’ creative work? What is the role of creativity across the human lifespan? How can creative work be a part of healthy adult life and healthy aging? We will especially consider the lives and work of artists. Because artists intensively imagine things that don’t yet exist, understanding artist’s experiences will enhance innovation and imagination. Students in the arts, liberal arts, sciences, and social sciences can apply the experience gained from studying the outcomes of creativity and working with established artists to other academic disciplines.\nStudents will engage in activities and projects as opposed to lectures and exams. Taught in an active-learning TILE classroom, Creativity for a Lifetime brings together the knowledge, skills, and life experiences of students and faculty members interested in an array of disciplines, including art and art history, anthropology, education, rhetoric, social work, aging studies, and the health sciences. To better appreciate the elements of successful aging, the richness of life-long learning, and an appreciation of the role of creative endeavor throughout a lifespan, students will meet Iowa artists and collect their oral histories.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

    "description": "Stories about cowgirls feature women who are at home in their bodies, connected with nature, and, often times, disrupting traditional gender roles. What is it about girls and horses that captures and holds the imagination well into adulthood? This course will look at cowgirl stories in our culture from a variety of viewpoints and in a number of cultural forms: songs, television shows, films, essays, and books. Guided by the rich and multiple ways our culture links cowgirl stories to themes of freedom and rebellion, students will do a number of short, multimodal assignments designed to explore how cowgirl stories influence our desire to subvert or seek traditional gender roles. In performing these short assignments, students will analyze and transform the many cowgirl stories existing in our culture to stake their own credible claim. The final project will draw directly from these short assignments and offer students the opportunity to showcase their work in an online format to gain skills relevant for publishing on the web.",

Our identities are conditioned by the stories we tell about ourselves, and the stories our societies encourage us to tell.\nIn this class, we will read theoretical material that introduces current thinking about the work that narrative does in the creation of identities, as well as material theorizing gender, especially masculinity. We will apply the insights we gain to narratives we find in the culture around us, from the classroom to the world at large. The critical analysis we do will be—broadly—ethnographic in its orientation, and I hope that students will be inclined to take an auto ethnographic turn in their production of a semester long project of research, analysis and—potentially—advocacy.",

    "description": "\"Sustainable” is a popular modifier, used to alter how we view the other words in close proximity: food, agriculture, energy, resource management, design, business, economies, models, programs, development, cities, and the more encompassing terms of place and space.  While each application develops and adopts sets of practices, how do these assemble to reveal a clearer picture of value, purpose, and intent? What are the sources for the critical terms defining “sustainability?” What narratives are used to influence, inform, and persuade? How might visual and audio combine with design, cartography, hard data, cultural mythology, marketing, research, and personal narrative?\nThis course takes a more interrogative, exploratory approach to the use and possibilities of “sustainability”. Evidence, analysis, creative and critical thinking will combine to shape our discussion of various texts, arguments, positions, and examinations of what is, what isn’t, and what could become ‘sustainable.’We’ll observe and investigate its more tangible, application in communities: small, local, large and global. We will take a closer read of “sustainability” as it is practiced, understood, argued, applied and misused/abused. We will look at systemic infrastructure and how “sustainability” offers challenge, demands risk, and engages possibility. Our scholarship will be active, interactive, personal, collaborative, “owned” and part of an emerging “creative and resilient commons.” Students will work individually and collaborate to develop, research, produce, and refine multimedia projects of their own chosen topic.\nThis course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.

    "description": "A talented teacher makes teaching appear effortless, but the art of teaching is anything but. If you’re considering teaching as a career or enjoy tutoring, the Supplemental Instruction in Rhetoric (SIR) Practicum provides the opportunity to practice the art of peer-to-peer teaching. Leaders will create lessons that teach critical speaking, reading, writing, and listening skills to students enrolled in Rhetoric. Leaders will be supported by course instructors throughout the practicum. Instructors and leaders will meet for one hour each week of the semester.\nThe first three weeks of the SIR Practicum will be spent discussing, reading, and honing best teaching practices such as, but not limited to: lesson planning, facilitating group sessions, motivating students, and Rhetoric pedagogy. After the third week of the semester (in addition to attending the SIR Practicum course one hour each week) SIR leaders will facilitate two SIR review sessions per week providing instruction to Rhetoric students until week fifteen of the semester. Practicum instructors will observe leaders’ teaching and provide constructive feedback at least two times during the semester. At the end of the semester, leaders will have compiled eleven weeks of lesson plans, two course observations, and teaching experience for their resume and/or teaching portfolio. The semester will conclude with teaching portfolio presentations reflecting on your experiences. There is no midterm or final exam.\nThe scheduling of practicum and peer-led tutoring sessions will be determined based on leaders’ schedules. Though specific times are to be determined, leaders should expect to hold sessions throughout the week and some evenings. Course registration is by permission only. Interested students must have completed Rhetoric to be eligible for the practicum. In addition, applicants must submit a letter of interest and one recommendation from a Rhetoric instructor or writing-based instructor. Application materials may be e-mailed to dana-thomann@uiowa.edu.  As this course is meant to facilitate peer-to-peer tutoring, only undergraduate students will be considered.",

Through weekly readings, class discussion, short written assignments and a group project this course will have you explore the evolution of human-dog interactions, and hopefully challenge and expand your view of the various roles dogs play in our lives, such as pet/companion, worker/service animal, food source, and entertainer. The course will begin with students exploring how dogs first evolved alongside Paleolithic and Neolithic human groups. We will then critically examine the moral, ethical, and cultural issues related to how we treat and interact with dogs in the modern world. Finally, we will consider how personal and cultural customs and practices are expressed through our interaction with dogs. \nThis course introduces students to how the study of social sciences and humanities have been used to engage big questions about who we are, how we live our life, and how we chose to interact with other species on this planet. Throughout the semester students will confront important questions, such as: How have human lives and society changed over time and across space? How do changes in the structure and organization of human social and political systems affect our treatment of non-human animals. What are the key moral and ethical issues related to people having power over animals?",

The work of a real-world forensic anthropologist, though far less glamorous than portrayed in the media, is just as intellectually stimulating. This course examines the topics of forensic anthropology and crime scene investigation through a realistic, applied approach. The course will begin with a brief history of forensic anthropology, followed by an overview of human osteology. Other covered topics will include how to approach a crime scene and how to distinguish between remains found in historical versus modern contexts. We will also examine postmortem processes affecting the human body, including decay rates in different environmental contexts and forensic entomology. This will lead us to techniques of estimating time since death and of determining the age, sex, and ancestry of a skeleton. We will also look at problem-solving case studies in forensic anthropology. This course will deal with mature subjects in a respectful manner, and will present graphic images of the postmortem human body. Discretion is advised.",

To enroll, students must be Honors students who have not yet fulfilled the General Education Rhetoric requirement. Pairing courses in this way will allow students to have a more sustained conversation around the course topics.\nThis is a course about ‘big questions’ related to environment and culture: How is my life connected to that of a village woman in India who spends hours cutting fuel wood to cook the family dinner? How is my life linked to global environmental change?  How should we live with the earth?  A team of five faculty will guide you through the process of addressing urgent, real world problems by focusing on the causes of environmental degradation in Rajasthan, India, in comparison with Iowa, in order to find possible solutions. We will explore how people, ideas and things cross borders - ‘globalization’- through issues of technology, social justice and environment by bringing together anthropology, gender studies, geography, energy science and development.  This course will promote critical thinking by prioritizing active learning via classroom activities, discussion and team work (facilitated by round tables in a TILE classroom), supplemented with short lectures.  Our emphasis will be on applying key concepts and models from both natural and social science to our case studies of India and the United States, a task that is both challenging and exciting.  Assignments will include weekly quizzes, exams, short essays, and a final research project.\n This section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common.

We will cover some basic concepts from the theoretical perspectives of the discipline and explore a range of topics that show how language and ideas about language contribute to the construction of our reality and social worlds. We will consider how the effects of language use emerge from interactions beyond individual control, and will explore relationships between language and group identity, including categories of ethnicity and gender. We will examine how language use derives its authority from specific institutions that promote particular forms and deny access both within individual states and globally. We will also evaluate differences in language’s social power across media (spoken, written, signed) of communication. Along the way students will come to appreciate a view of human language as a particularly structured system of signs.

Via lectures, discussion and (hopefully) sporadic food tasting sessions, you will be challenged to study eating and drinking in all its variety and importance in different contemporary cultures of the world. We shall explore: How and why food and drink hold the power to bind people together or to set groups apart. How are national cuisines made? How do people connect food and drink to ritual and health care systems? These questions and many more will be linked with the study of food and drink production and consumption to examine societal processes such as the construction of identities and symbolic meanings attached to eating and drinking.",

    "description": "Health professionals are increasingly called upon to understand the complex social and cultural dimensions of sickness and healing, in order to provide the best quality care to culturally diverse populations. Knowledge of how social, cultural and biological factors interact, both to produce disease and to influence the course of healing, is increasingly emphasized in entrance examinations for health-related graduate and professional programs (such as the Medical College Admissions Test, which will include new sections on these topics starting in 2015). This introductory-level course introduces key cultural and social influences on sickness and healing, illustrating with examples from throughout the globe and across the different subfields of anthropology. Sometimes called “the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities,” anthropology offers well-developed concepts and numerous case studies that help to improve cross-cultural understanding of the social and biological foundations of human health. This course also emphasizes the development of critical reading skills that students need in order to best understand works from the medical social sciences and humanities.",

Although a variety of infectious agents will be considered, the emphasis will be on those that cause serious mortality and morbidity in humans today. For each of the major classes of pathogen – viruses, bacteria and pathogenic eukaryotes – we will learn how genetic variation is generated, how the spread of these pathogens can be reconstructed using phylogenetic and other evolutionary techniques, and how they are able to evade host immune responses and cause disease in humans. Special emphasis will be given to new, emerging diseases, such as HIV and swine-origin influenza virus, and the evolutionary forces that allow these pathogens to jump into and establish themselves in modern human populations.",

    "description": "Religious and spiritual healing have been deployed as a major part of medical practice for thousands of years and, conversely, healing has been a major part of religious practice for as long as religion has existed. Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.",

Group and inter-individual behaviors will be presented based on the fundamentals of evolutionary theory and the role of sexual and social interaction in the evolution of higher primates. In addition, an understanding of group structure and mating systems will be reached through an evaluation of ecological constraints imposed on primates in different habitats with an emphasis on the Great Apes. Subjects include: primate taxonomy, diet, predation, cooperation and competition, community ecology, kinship and mating strategies, human-non-human primate interactions, and conservation. The course format includes lectures, discussion, and videos. Requirements include one midterm exam, one take home final exam, and a PowerPoint presentation on a topic of the student's choice.",

This graduate-level seminar will focus on one such ongoing theoretical rivalry—that which pits the materialist/explanatory approach, giving priority to physical environment and infrastructure, against the symbolic/interpretive (or “idealist”) approach, emphasizing the influence of ideas, meanings, and categories. Our readings and discussions will evoke related sets of contrasts within anthropology, such as science versus the humanities, “emic” versus “etic” perspectives, structure versus agency, etc. The seminar is open to graduate students in any field and to anthropology honors undergraduates. It will be useful for students from any discipline in understanding culture as a dynamic process, and for anthropology students wanting to be more firmly grounded in the history of thought in their field.",

No previous knowledge of anthropology or linguistics is presumed. The course has a strong historical component which situates several theoretical traditions. Following an introductory consideration of language as a formal system from a semiotic point of view that emphasizes the relationship between form and function, readings turn to issues in linguistic anthropology and ways in which anthropology has construed the relationship between language and culture. Consideration is given to issues of classical and contemporary research, including ethnoscience or lexical semantics, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, speech act theory and philosophy of speech, ethnography of speaking, performance and oral poetics, critical discourse analysis, language ideology and metalanguage, and linguistic hegemony and language politics.",

To better prepare the students for their contribution to future empirical manuscripts, students will be asked to present a research paper from literature in their field of interest once during the semester and prepare a critical analysis of a primary research paper.  The week before their presentation is to be made, the students meet with one of the coordinators to discuss any questions they have about the article and to receive input on their electronic presentation.\nThe student presenting is also responsible for creating a list of questions focused on key techniques and scientific principles discussed in the article. These questions, along with the selected research article, are distributed in advance to the other IBA scholars, who are each assigned one question to which they must respond during the presentation. This process ensures that all students become “experts” in one aspect of the presentation and that they are actively engaged in each of the presentations.\nEach student will also be required to give a 5-7 minute short talk on their research.  This talk will be practice for the Scholar Symposium event held at the end of the semester.",

The course builds on computational (programming) and bioscience (genetics/genomics) topics. It seeks to provide broad exposure to common tools, and provide enough experience in applying them to contemporary problem settings to serve as a gateway to electives in Bioinformatics. For students who already have a software and computing background (have taken at least ENGR:1300 and ENGR:2730 or equivalent), this course provides a solid bio-context for using those previously developed skills. Students who do not have any previous computing experience should not take this course. Topics include: Tools at the developer level: UNIX, BioPerl, BLAST/BLAT, R, web-based tools, Apache, PHP, etc. Common Data Models: NCBI/EMBL, sequence, expression, proteomics, systems biology/pathways, clinical information, genotyping, structural chemistry (pdb), etc. Data Analysis and Annotation: e.g., transcription and expression, genomics, proteomics, clustering, basic linkage, comparative genomics, statistical genetics. Common access and APIs to data repositories and results: Interface design, submission protocols, data exchange formats, web services, etc. LIMS: Laboratory Information Management Systems: Raw experimental data, protocol management, experiment design specifications.",

    "description": "This course is intended to provide a rigorous and formal introduction to the science of statistical reasoning, broadly speaking, as used in different ECE sub-disciplines. Specifically, students who wish to take future elective ECE classes on Communication Theory, Control Theory, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Digital Signal Processing may find this class to be useful. However, more broadly, our aim is to introduce the fundamental theoretical underpinnings of modern “data science” and “machine learning” methods.\n \nThe class is targeted at upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. Students enrolling in this class must be familiar with basic signals and systems and probability concepts. Specifically, a working knowledge of Fourier series and transforms, linear filtering, random variables and probability densities and distributions is essential. However, knowledge of more advanced concepts such as sampling theory, random processes and characteristic functions will not be assumed.\n \nThis class will be unapologetically abstract and mathematical; it is not “hands-on” in any way, there are no labs and while there will be references to practical applications, that is explicitly not the focus of this class. The class will be lecture based with weekly Homework including some computational assignments that will require the use of MATLAB (or similar) software.\n \nA tentative list of topics is as follows:1. Axioms of probability; random variables and distributions; the philosophy of probability; Bayesian v. frequentist approaches to probability; likelihood v. probability; puzzles and paradoxes2. Densities, distributions and characteristic functions; the Law of Large Numbers; Chebyshev and Chernoff Bounds; multi-variate Gaussian rvs; the Central Limit Theorem3. Stochastic processes; stationarity and ergodicity; autocorrelation, cross-correlation and spectral densities; Gaussian processes; Markov chains4. The problem of parameter estimation; concept of sufficient statistics; minimality and unbiasedness; linear estimators; minimum-variance unbiased estimators5. The problem of detection or hypothesis testing; the Neyman-Pearson lemma; recever-operating characteristics; detection with Gaussian processes; the matched filter6. Likelihood functions; the maximum likelihood principle; the Fisher Matrix and the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound; ML-identification of linear systems7. Monte-Carlo methods; importance sampling and particle filtering8. Non-parametric detection and estimation; principal component analysis; independent component analysis; support vector machines",

After a careful consideration of a number of fundamental terms and principles, students examine approximately 16 important dramatic texts, each one embodying a different approach to dramatic structure.  Of special concern is the status these plays have as blueprints for performances that occur before audiences in space and in time.  The dual objectives of the course are to develop basic skills in the critical reading and close analysis of dramatic texts with respect to issues of structure, and to exercise our imaginations with respect to the potential challenges of putting these texts into production.",

We will strive to discover what makes collaboration successful in multiple contexts and what our arts have in common, all in the process of creating collaborative work. Participation in class discussions and exercises is required. Activities will include presentations, work sharing, discussion of assigned study materials, and performance studies. Grades will be based on participation, creative and/or technical contribution to the final project, and a reflection paper on collaborative performance principles and practical issues.\n \nStudents registering for the 4 s.h. option will have additional hours in the theatre and rehearsals outside of class.",

Requirements: In addition to attendance and participation, requirements include one short paper, one discussion leadership, a midterm, and a final examination.",

Principles explored in this course will be:  The poise of the head in fluid relationship to the spine;  responses to gravity; developing sensory awareness and understanding the process of change;  conscious use of of energy and direction to support natural phrasing; \"body mapping\" and experiential anatomy to clarify how movement takes place most easily. Physical participation in this studio course will include lying down, rolling, sitting, standing, locomotion and your skilled activity.  Alexander Technique is most often taught through light touch, thinking and visualization:  Students will learn some principles of listening to information from their hands through touch, and how to learn through the kinesthetic information supplied by touch.  Work outside of class time will include a journal, observations, and take-home questions.  Students will be expected to practice daily and explore the use of the principles learned with their specific performance area or in service of other unique goals.",

    "description": "Collaborative Performance has been created through the Department of Dance to bring together dance artists and advanced practitioners from varied disciplines for the purpose of creating an environment for artistic collaboration, culminating in a devised “dance” performance. Each student will contribute their expertise to the process of investigating: artistic intent and how that intent can be revealed through dance and the various arts represented in the class; the personal visions of a choreographer, director, writer, or other lead artist and how that can integrate with others’ creativity in a coherent, focused, collaborative whole; experimenting, communicating, and discovering the different artistic languages we speak across disciplines. We will strive to discover what makes collaboration successful in multiple contexts and what our arts have in common, all in the process of creating collaborative work. Participation in class discussions and exercises is required. Activities will include presentations, work sharing, discussion of assigned study materials, and performance studies. Grades will be based on participation, creative and/or technical contribution to the final project, and a reflection paper on collaborative performance principles and practical issues.\n \nStudents registering for the 4 s.h. option will have additional hours in the theatre and rehearsals outside of class.",

    "description": "Aging was long thought to be a passive process of deterioration due to the accumulation of damage over time. In the last two decades, however, it has become apparent that aging may not be a simple decline of function over time, but instead, a consequence of regulatory mechanisms that actively control how cells, tissues, and organisms respond to their environment. This is the central topic that will be examined in this course. The general objectives of this course are to understand, at a basic level: whether all organisms age, why organisms age, what factors determine the rate of aging and why certain diseases are associated with aging. We will discuss the evolutionary theories of aging, and the molecular genetics of aging, cell biology of aging, tissue homeostasis and aging, and organ-function/dysfunction during aging, as it pertains to healthy aging and disease.",

    "description": "Ecology is the study of factors that influence the distribution and abundance of living organisms. The course surveys relevant topics across the biological hierarchy, covering how and why individuals and populations adapt to changing environments, what determines which and how many species inhabit particular ecological communities, and the factors that shape ecosystems. We will use a combination of case studies drawn from nature, theoretical approaches, and simulation modeling to illuminate these topics.\nADDITIONAL TEXTBOOK INFORMATION: This course uses a SimUtext package (online, interactive text).

    "description": "The application of the techniques of molecular biology, genomics, neuropharmacology and functional brain imaging has contributed greatly to our understanding of the way in which the brain works. Many of us want to study neurobiology with the goal of obtaining answers to some of the most fundamental questions about ourselves. What is the nature of my consciousness? To what extent is my behavior determined by my genes, my environment, my free will? This course will examine how neuroscientists design experiments that provide information that will help us address these questions.\nTEXTBOOK INFORMATION\nIt is recommended that students purchase one of two optional textbooks. Students who will take Neurobiology in 2018 may want to purchase the textbook Neuroscience (Purves et al.), as it will be a required for that course. Students with a limited background may choose to purchase Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain (Bear et al.). This text covers topics at a more introductory level than Purves et al. These textbooks will also be on reserve at the Sciences Library.\nOPTIONAL TEXTBOOKS\nTitle: Neuroscience, Fifth Edition, ISBN 978-0-87893-646-5, Author: Purves et al., Publisher: Sinauer Associates, Copyright Year: 2012, Retail Price: $132.95\nOR\nTitle: Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain, Fourth Edition, ISBN 978-0-7817-7817-6, Author: Bear et al., Publisher: Wolters Kluwer, Copyright Year: 2015, Retail Price: $131.99",

    "description": "Communicating Research is a small, discussion-based seminar that focuses on the written and oral communication of science to various types of audiences and is facilitated by an experienced Ph.D. scientific researcher.  Students learn skills to become an effective independent researcher and science communicator. Products of the seminar include: a draft of a research proposal or thesis, a 10-minute oral research presentation that is geared towards a scientist audience, an essay about the student’s research that can be read by a non-scientist audience, and a 3-minute “elevator pitch” that can be adapted for various audiences.\nIt is expected that students enrolled in this course have already identified a faculty mentor to guide their independent research experience in a laboratory on campus. For information on how to identify a research mentor click here or contact the course instructor.\nThe curriculum for this course is adapted from published curriculum \"Entering Research: A course that creates community and structure for beginning undergraduate researchers in the STEM disciplines\" (2010) CBE Life Science Education 9(2):108-18.",

Presentations will be chalk-talks with concise handouts. PowerPoint or overhead projector use will be discouraged. The grading will be based on how effectively the participants communicate different subjects both within and outside their immediate research areas. Each participant will be required to present multiple times, i.e. several short presentations for highlighting papers and one major presentation for critical analysis of a major research paper. The participant will also be required to submit a final written report based on his or her presentations. However, these will be in the format of abstract, i.e. concise review of the major points of the papers. This course will also serve as good practice for teaching general subjects to a “naïve” or a general audience, e.g. situations faced by TA’s in undergraduate laboratory courses.If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.",

    "description": "With human population growth and resource consumption growing exponentially, the impact of human interaction with the rest of our environment is increasingly relevant in many fields of study. Environmental Science is the interdisciplinary study of how Earth's natural systems interact, how these systems affect society, and how they respond to human activity. Environmental Science has the applied goal of solving environmental problems, drawing upon knowledge in disciplines as diverse as ecology, anthropology, economics, and political science. The specific student learning outcomes for the overall course are:\n\nAbility to critically evaluate popular media articles related to Environmental Science;\nAbility to locate and interpret data relevant to Environmental Science and interpret it;\nUnderstanding the relationship between their day-to-day life and Environmental Science, particularly in the context of sustainability;\nRecognize the multi-faceted nature of Environmental Science.\n\nThis course is taught in a blended environment, including traditional lectures, discussion periods in TILE classrooms, online learning, and both individual and group projects.",

    "description": "This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n \nAs part of the University of Iowa’s “Big Ideas” curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the “Age of Petroleum,” an age in which we continue to live.\n \nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years? What were the factors behind oil’s emergence as the world’s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth’s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n \n \n \nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for “Historical Perspectives,” students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n \n \n \nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

In addition to pragmatic lessons focused on the modes of writing students can expect to encounter in a professional environment, our approach will include readings and creative exercises in fiction and personal narrative, through which students will further develop their attention to the written word and their ability to express themselves distinctively and persuasively. Each student will ultimately produce a portfolio of original work that demonstrates his or her ability to write effectively and revise thoughtfully. By the end of the semester, each student will have improved his or her ability to:  • Write clearly, succinctly, and professionally • Apply fundamental principles of workplace writing to adapt his or her writing skills to the particular requirements of any job • Read closely and critically, with an eye toward effective editing • Articulate a set of values from which he or she might proceed as an ethical leader, decision-maker, or participant in a workplaceThis section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

    "description": "These days, it’s harder than ever to write without the distractions of the outside world. You may be sitting down to write a short story when your phone tells you that somebody liked your Tweet, hear about campus drama on Yik Yak, discover that an online literary journal is accepting contest submissions for five more minutes, and then become intrigued by an article your friend posted on Facebook and fall into a click bait wormhole. These media interventions don’t mean it’s not possible to hole up in a cabin to write a perfect short story anymore, but that the texture of our reality is changing and that our writing can reflect that reality. We’ll discuss how social media platforms, literary journals, self-publishing, Tumblr and other online communities, YouTube, and other innovations have allowed creative people to reach a larger audience and how this has impacted the world of creative writing.\nThis class will run as part laboratory, part salon. The ultimate goal is not for you to walk away feeling like a literary media guru, but for you to improve your creative writing chops and to have a deeper understanding of how the media has changed the face of creative writing. We’ll discuss the political and ethical aspects of new media, read short fiction that pushes the boundaries of form, explore hypertext fiction, watch YouTube shows, analyze Twitter profiles, read online lit journals, and will do much more to develop a deeper understanding of how media affects creative writing today. Class attendance and participation will factor heavily into your grade, as will your work on a group project and a creative project of your own. Exploration and experimentation are always encouraged.",

Students must enroll for both courses by using the Courses in Common option number 47. To enroll, students must be Honors students who have not yet fulfilled the General Education Rhetoric requirement. Pairing courses in this way will allow students to have a more sustained conversation around the course topics.\nThis is a course about ‘big questions’ related to environment and culture: How is my life connected to that of a village woman in India who spends hours cutting fuel wood to cook the family dinner? How is my life linked to global environmental change?  How should we live with the earth?  A team of five faculty will guide you through the process of addressing urgent, real world problems by focusing on the causes of environmental degradation in Rajasthan, India, in comparison with Iowa, in order to find possible solutions. We will explore how people, ideas and things cross borders - ‘globalization’- through issues of technology, social justice and environment by bringing together anthropology, gender studies, geography, energy science and development.  This course will promote critical thinking by prioritizing active learning via classroom activities, discussion and team work (facilitated by round tables in a TILE classroom), supplemented with short lectures.  Our emphasis will be on applying key concepts and models from both natural and social science to our case studies of India and the United States, a task that is both challenging and exciting.  Assignments will include weekly quizzes, exams, short essays, and a final research project.\n This section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common.

The class persistently investigates an apparent contradiction: why and how have acts and desires typically valued as highly personal and private (our \"sex lives\") been consistently made available to a mass public through popular, commercial media in modern America? Emphasizing the intertwined fascination with heterosexuality and homosexuality in mass media since the publication of the infamous Kinsey Reports just after WWII, this class considers popular responses to and representations of (among other events): the contradictory sexual discourses of the Cold War era, the “sexual revolution” and the rise of the women’s liberation movement, gay liberation and “queer” activism, and recent manifestations of “post-feminist” ideologies.  Readings for the course include a wide range of primary materials in various genres (fiction, drama, memoir, journalism, etc.) as well as retrospective historical and cultural studies. Students are required to attend two weekly (heavily illustrated) lectures by the course instructor and one weekly discussion section led by a teaching assistant. Course requirements include a series of short essays and response papers, a midterm and final exam, and regular attendance and participation (in discussion sections).",

As part of its focus, sociology investigates and exposes aspects of social life that are usually taken for granted. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender organizes and structures the social world in which we live. To this end, we will be investigating such topics as the predominant theoretical stances related to the study of gender, femininities and masculinities, how gender structures everyday social interaction, and how social institutions (e.g., education, work, family, the media) create gendered meanings and structures. Finally, we will conclude by considering ways to intervene in many of the processes that perpetuate gender-based inequality",

This course will look at cowgirl stories in our culture from a variety of viewpoints and in a number of cultural forms: songs, television shows, films, essays, and books. Guided by the rich and multiple ways our culture links cowgirl stories to themes of freedom and rebellion, students will do a number of short, multimodal assignments designed to explore how cowgirl stories influence our desire to subvert or seek traditional gender roles. In performing these short assignments, students will analyze and transform the many cowgirl stories existing in our culture to stake their own credible claim. The final project will draw directly from these short assignments and offer students the opportunity to showcase their work in an online format to gain skills relevant for publishing on the web.",

    "description": "Sexual experimentation among religious groups is applauded by some as freedom from the constraints of dogmatic religions and scorned by others as abominable behavior by amoral people.  Although ideas about proper sexual behavior are deeply ingrained in the American psyche those ideas receive little attention until a person or group acts in a way that catches our attention and challenges our notions about sexual behavior.  Some of those behaviors that have gained attention include polygamy, polyamory or multiple partners, sex outside of marriage, same-sex relations, and sex with underage children.  This class examines the histories, practices, and beliefs of religious groups that caught their neighbor’s attention because the groups engaged in practices that their neighbors found offensive or violated state and federal laws.  Those practices include sexual relations, institution of marriage, organization of family units, and parenting.  Some of the groups that the class will look at include:  Shakers, Oneida Community, Mormon Church (19th century) and Children of God, Peoples Temple, and Branch Davidians (20th century).  The class will examine why those religious groups were attacked by outsiders, why members chose to join or remain with such groups, and how the beliefs and practices of these groups reflected or challenged notions of gender and sexuality.",

    "description": "English majors may apply this course to the following area and/or period requirement. AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies. PERIOD: 20th/21st century literature for Fall 2017.\nIn a June 1959 Playboy article titled, “The Origins of the Beat Generation,” Jack Kerouac defined the modern Beats as wise men of few words, accompanied by women of fewer, writing: “The ‘cool’ (hipster) today is your bearded laconic sage, or schlerm, before a hardly touched beer in a beatnik dive, whose speech is low and unfriendly, whose girls say nothing and wear black.” Traditionally, critics have understood the position of women within the Beat community as peripheral, marking the literary “boy gang” of writers as a self-sustaining homosocial artistic community. For many years, with the notable exception of Diane di Prima, few women writers gained recognition as part of this literary movement, but in recent decades, memoirs by Beat women have spurred feminist recovery efforts to set the record straight. In this course, we will consider the place of these women writers within the Beat canon. We will first begin the semester by defining “Beat” together, focusing on work by foundational Beat writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. Next, we will turn to memoirs written by the women of the Beat Generation to consider the role of this genre within reconstructions of the Beat canon. Finally, we will examine fiction and poetry by these women writers, thinking about how our definitions of “Beat” change by broadening the term to encompass these works, as well as drawing connections between these writers’ aesthetics and stories.",

Students will be responsible for facilitating the Women's Collective program, a 12 week curriculum using women's circles focussed on healthy relationships between people, domestic violence, sexual assault, race, class, gender, and power and control. The purpose of the curriculum is to help women who are incarcerated explore ways to have productive, non violent relationships, that are positive and egalitarian. Graduate and undergraduate students from various disciplines are welcomed. Students will also be asked to read scholarly texts in order to learn more about incarceration in North America, and intersectionality. They will also be expected to discuss these topics, write a series of deep reflections about their work at the correctional institution, and full participate as a facilitator in the program.NOTE: The Friday meeting time is spent at the Mitchelville Women's Prison.

    "description": "In the last two decades, it seems like everything has been queered.  We have queer theory/queer politics, queer citizenship, queer performativity, genderqueer, the New Queer cinema, the new New Queer cinema, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Queer as Folk—and these are only some of the examples that explicitly use queer as a signifier. It should be clear that the meaning of “queer” is up for grabs as all of these examples employ related but different connotations of the term. The reclamation of “queer” has been a welcome development in some circles, while in others “queer” may connote, among other things, racism, sexism, and/or politically paralyzing theory. Each of these positions is informed by different interpretations of the meaning of “queer,” interpretations that conflict over the importance of one’s identity, actions, and sexuality. We will enter these debates from the perspective of engaged intellectuals, concerned with improving cultural modes of democratic practice. These practices include activities such as the production and consumption of various kinds of media and legal rhetorics, the use of public and private spaces, and the possibilities of coalitional politics. As engaged intellectuals we will allow political practices and academic theorizing to inform one another as each one of us develop our stance on the utility of rhetorics of queer identities, theories, and politics.",

Conversations and contemplation relating to the significance and meanings of sex and sexuality take place all around us, including within families, at places of worship, in court rooms, at government offices, among friends, and within various media. In this class, we work to understand how constructions of sex and sexuality in the US shape society, our experiences, and our identities. We will explore some of the manners in which intimate aspects of our lives are shaped by political, economic, and historical contexts with attention to how ideologies of race, class, ethnicity, nation, and gender intersect with and inform our behaviors, relationships, and the meanings we attach to them. This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

They will solicit and read the work of others and create their own work for publication.  In small affinity groups, they will serve as content and design editors, production and distribution coordinators, and organizers of social outreach and community reading/performance events--all in ways that foreground diversity, inclusion, and mentoring. \nStudents enrolling in the class should be GWSS or SJUS majors or advanced minors and be proficient/experienced in one or more of these practices: writing, editing, art and new media, digital design, and community activism and outreach.

    "description": "Do women have a history? How is it different from the history we've learned in high school and college textbooks?In this course, we discover what it means to study women's experience in the past.  What do the most important developments in American history look like when we explore them from the perspective of a Maine midwife, an Iowa farm woman, or an enslaved domestic servant? How does our view of the most significant events and developments in American history change when we measure historical importance by what was most important in women's lives?To answer these questions, we study both the familiar and the unfamiliar, such as the history of sexuality, intimacy, and motherhood, as well as the history of women's paid and unpaid work. We will explore how women, as political actors, shaped the outcome of familiar events (the American Revolution, the Civil War), but also how they organized social movements around the important issues of their lives -- such as the abolition of slavery and the right to consent to sexual intimacy. We will consider how women's inequality was established in law and social practice, as well as how women thought about and challenged inequality.Our focus includes the distinct, but interconnected histories of different groups of women -- free and enslaved, southern and northern, indigenous and immigrant, working-class and elite. We will read histories, primary documents like diaries and memoirs, and grapple with the difference between our own experience and the experiences of women in the past.In addition to required readings and occasional homework assignments, course requirements include a short essay assignment, an eight-rage research paper on a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor, and take-home midterm and final exams.",

    "description": "Over the last twenty-five years, theorists in a variety of disciplines have been developing an appreciation of narrative in the cultural and social construction of reality, including human identity. Our identities are conditioned by the stories we tell about ourselves, and the stories our societies encourage us to tell.\nIn this class, we will read theoretical material that introduces current thinking about the work that narrative does in the creation of identities, as well as material theorizing gender, especially masculinity. We will apply the insights we gain to narratives we find in the culture around us, from the classroom to the world at large. The critical analysis we do will be—broadly—ethnographic in its orientation, and I hope that students will be inclined to take an auto ethnographic turn in their production of a semester long project of research, analysis and—potentially—advocacy.",

We will use inquiry-based activities to build success in critical thinking, teamwork, and effective written and oral communication. Topics include the origin of the universe, the biochemistry of life and the origin of life on Earth. Designed for first and second year students, this fall semester course fulfills 3 s.h. of the Natural Sciences GE requirement. A second and recommended course offered in the spring semester, entitled, \"Big Ideas: Evolution of Life and Search for Life in the Universe\", continues with these themes and includes a laboratory. Together, these courses fulfill the entire 7 s.h. Natural Sciences GE requirement for students in College of Liberal Arts & Sciences and Colleges where a  course with laboratory is required.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.",

Scientists often also produce such beautiful patterns in computer-generated images.  In this first year seminar, students will be given the chance to use existing scientific computer code to generate artistic prints based on scientific data. Examples include: models for snowflake formation, random walks and other examples where complex patterns can be generated from simple rules. Students will collaborate with the course instructor (a computational particle physicist), an engineering professor and also two world-class artists (printmakers in the long-standing tradition of expertise at U Iowa). The printing sessions will take place at Studio Arts and the Nexus studio.\nNo computer expertise is required and in a first approach, only a few ``knobs\" need to be turned to obtain interesting variations. Weekly readings will be assigned from the books ``Symmetry\" by H. Weyl and ``Chance and Chaos\" by D. Ruelle. Grade will be based on class participation and short presentations.",

Also how much we could reconstruct back from the cosmological evidence, the study of the cosmic microwave background and from experimental particle physics performed at the high energy accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN laboratory in Geneva. We will also discuss what questions we are still seeking responses to, what mysterious happenings we observe, still remain to be solved. Along the way we will need to describe how historically this knowledge developed, how we went from observation of our solar system to our galaxy to way beyond. What and how these measurements progressed, how they are currently made, along with the progress in technology: electronics, material science, real time data acquisition, handling and processing and storing large volume of data, will be discussed.",

    "description": "We may not all believe that it’s better to have love and lost than never to have loved at all, but the experience of love is hard to imagine without the experience of loss. This course will look at the human experience of love, loss, and longing across a wide variety of traditions and time periods. The idea will be to glance into a number of literatures without having to identify a single thread or story among them other than our own responses and reflections. This will be an exercise in reading for better living, in learning a bit about how others have thought about love and loss in order to expand our own ways of seeing the world. There won’t be any books to purchase. The readings will be available online. We will work on paying close attention to short texts through simple readings. Our aim will always be to engage the imagination. There will be a series of shorter written assignments, an oral presentation, and a final written project. Some of the readings will be drawn from the likes of Homer, Sappho (the only ancient Greek female poet we know by name), Plato, the anonymous authors of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, the (also anonymous) early Spanish-language texts known as jarchas, the Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus, the Medieval troubadour poets of southern France, Baroque Spanish and Italian verse, and the writings of the great seventeenth-century Mexican nun Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. We’ll think a bit about different kinds of love, what it means to feel so strongly the presence of something that no longer exists or that is far away, about the nature of life, death, joy, sorrow, that sort of thing. Along the way we’ll also pause to consider what it means to read things in translation, what it means to read a text of something which was originally meant for oral performance, and how it is that some things have survived the ages and come down to us as important.",

    "description": "Although talk of ghosts and the supernatural was discouraged by Confucius, tales of the dead and their doings abound from earliest times. What is a ghost in traditional Chinese culture? Where do ghosts live? What is the underworld like? How (and why) do ghosts interact with people? Are they friends, lovers, enemies, or simply indifferent? Who is more powerful, humans or ghosts? This course introduces a variety of Chinese ghost stories and tales of the weird from ancient times to 1800. The earliest ones are presented as historical accounts, often intended to teach moral lessons, while the latest are pure fiction, intended to be read for pleasure and entertainment. We will consider questions related to literary form and intent: what is history, what is fiction, and how permeable is the boundary between the real and the fantastic? The major writing assignments for this course will be creative: students will select and rewrite two of the ghost stories we read, perhaps updating the setting to modern times or moving the story from China to Iowa, changing the ending or other plot elements, transforming or adding characters, making a scary story campy or fun, or giving a happy story a tragic ending or vice versa, and write an essay discussing the changes. Other assignments include frequent in-class writing, brief reading response essays, quizzes/reading checks, regular attendance and enthusiastic class participation. This is a discussion-based course and attendance is required.",

This course explores a variety of works from German, British, and Russian literatures and cultures from the Early Modern period to the present with this topic. Students also critique the different twist that the fascination with the forbidden takes in regard to women. Student responsibilities include active participation, four reading responses, two analytical papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam or paper.\nThe 4 s.h. option is for students who wish to apply the course to their requirements for the major or minor in German. German majors and minors may apply this course to their requirement for literature or elective courses taught in German if they complete an additional in-depth study in German as outlined in the syllabus.\nHonors contract option: Research on an addition pact plot in your culture or creative option. \nGoals: \n\nStudents become acquainted with major literary and filmic representations of “selling one’s soul” for a desired goal, including Goethe’s play Faust, Milton’s Paradise Lost, and Bulgakov’s Master and Margarita as well as musical adaptations. They learn about a variety of genres.\nThe theme lends itself to examining humankind's and individual's self-understanding, identity, and goals.\nIn investigating this well-known cultural concept and its ethical implications, students examine basic values, decision-making, and the incomprehensibility of evil in history and in life stories.\nStudents strengthen open-mindedness and the ability to evaluate their own attitudes and beliefs in comparison with other times and cultures.\nStudents practice critical analysis and learn and demonstrate appropriate research skills in the Humanities.\nStudents practice and expand their verbal, communicative, perceptual, and possibly creative skills.",

Other topics include Symbolism in Republican China and the world, Lao She’s “Beijing flavor” and Eileen Chang’s “Shanghai style” in war times, writers in “Communist holy land” Yan’an, post-1980s avant-gardism, and online literature. Political, familial, ethnic, gender, and sexual relations are analyzed, as are human-environment relations and existential relation with oneself, which intertwine particular times and places but are also relatable to “elsewhen and elsewhere.”\nAll materials are in English translation.

This course can be repeated for a cumulative total of 3 s.h.\nIn consultation with the Translate Iowa Project officers, students develop a semester plan of work and submit it to the faculty supervisor for approval by the end of the first week of classes. They then submit work reports every two weeks specifying the tasks they accomplished and reporting the hours worked during that period. Students will also meet periodically with their faculty supervisor (usually once a month, by arrangement) to discuss their work. By the end of the semester, students will submit a portfolio of their translations and a final report on the work they performed on the Translate Iowa Project, including a discussion of what they learned from working on the TIP.\nContact Prof. Denise Filios (denise-filios@uiowa.edu) for information about enrolling in this course.\nIf you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.",

The literature represented includes current writings from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. Text materials (short fiction, poetry, excerpts from plays) are available on the course web site. The authors speak about their own writing and how their work relates to the literary scene in their countries. Literary issues such as translation, censorship, women's writing, and some background historical, political, or cultural information may be discussed in defining the specific literary context of a work, but the course focuses on the writing itself, its artistry and themes. During the remaining weeks of the semester, students read and discuss several contemporary literary works, both poetry and prose, with special attention to the themes brought alive by the visiting writers.\nFirst year students and sophomores with interest in world literature are welcome in the class, and should be able to complete the assignments successfully.\nStudents' participation includes preparing weekly questions for the visitors, keeping a journal, as well as two papers (for 3 s.h.).",

We will look at some of the basics of music and how it is put together as well as how the brain works to process sound, melody, harmony, and rhythm. With this, we will look at all different kinds of music to see how they are similar and how societies from around the world differ in their relationship with music. We will also investigate how music therapy works and have several guest speakers to talk about their experience with music.  There will always be a lot to listen to every class as well as reading assignments.

How to set up the Mac and Getting Started with GarageBand.\n2. Music theory basics (maj/min keys, notation, transposition, harmony)\n3. Composition basics (the blues, AABA, & various basic song forms)\n4. Drop-n-drag with apple loops (arranging possibilities)\n5. Using the multi-track recorder (first with real instruments/microphones)\n6. Using software instruments (using the MIDI keyboards/guitars)\n7. Applying the variety of effects (reverb, echo, compression, EQ)\n8. Using plug-ins (downloading and importing from the web)\n9. Mixing process (automation, panning, volume levels, etc)\n10.

The course does not meet in a regular classroom setting; however, if at any time you have questions or concerns about Recital Attendance, please visit the course page at ICON. It is your responsibility to read and follow the syllabus.

The concept of “great musician” and the consequent notion of “good music” is central to how we experience and talk about music and musical performance. This course aims to both survey a wide variety of “great musicians”—from Bach to Fatboy Slim—and encourage critical assessment of how we determine “greatness” in musical expression. Selected musicians will be studied within the framework of four themes: Music and Religious Life, Music and Theater, Music and Politics, and Music and Place. \nCourse requirements include one 5-minute presentation, three short writing assignments, listening quizzes, and two exams.",

We will examine the development, maturation, and demise of the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership as well as the role George Martin and his engineers played in turning the Beatles’ sonic explorations into hit singles and groundbreaking records. Concurrently students will critique the impact Beatlemania had on British and American cultures as well as its role in opening up Eastern Europe to the West.  Innovations made in the recording and marketing of albums and films, and the difficulties the group encountered in managing royalties, copyrights, and various business ventures are covered.  Students will view several of the Beatles’ various television appearances and films and develop an in-depth understanding of their music.  Students will gain knowledge of British and American cultural history through the “window” the Beatles and their music provide. \n \nThis course is open to all students; including non-music majors.",

    "description": "The cultural narrative of popular women musicians offers a unique view from which to study American and British history and society. From Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Patsy Cline, Janis Joplin, Chrissie Hynde and Patti Smith to Madonna, the Spice Girls, Alanis Morissette, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Pink, Beyoncé and Adele, female performers have challenged and redefined the manner in which the music industry and fans respond to issues of gender, sexuality, identity, authenticity, and artistry. In this course students examine the history of popular women musicians and the influence their lyrics, music and performances have had on American and British culture. Concurrently students explore the impact which civil rights, the British Invasion (i.e. the Beatles and the Rolling Stones), second wave feminism, the counterculture, social injustices, war, music education, rock festivals and charity concerts have had on women’s music careers.\nOur exploration cuts across cultures and ethnicity as we analyze the rise and fall of early girl groups such as the Shirelles, the Supremes, and the Ronettes, the dynamics of mixed gender groups including The Mamas and the Papas, Fleetwood Mac, Blondie, and Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees, and the social lyricism of Joan Baez, Sinéad O’Connor, Suzanne Vega, and Tracy Chapman. Through the lens of female performers’ unfamiliarity with their precursors, the construction of canon will be critiqued.If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may contact the course instructor in order to request permission to enroll.",

Principles explored in this course will be:  The poise of the head in fluid relationship to the spine;  responses to gravity; developing sensory awareness and understanding the process of change;  conscious use of of energy and direction to support natural phrasing; \"body mapping\" and experiential anatomy to clarify how movement takes place most easily. Physical participation in this studio course will include lying down, rolling, sitting, standing, locomotion and your skilled activity.  Alexander Technique is most often taught through light touch, thinking and visualization:  Students will learn some principles of listening to information from their hands through touch, and how to learn through the kinesthetic information supplied by touch.  Work outside of class time will include a journal, observations, and take-home questions.  Students will be expected to practice daily and explore the use of the principles learned with their specific performance area or in service of other unique goals.",

    "description": "This course will examine the history of Europe from the collapse of Rome (ca. 400) to the year 1100.  Our work will range from the history of daily life to cultural and intellectual history, in order to gain as full a glimpse as possible of this distant world.  The period is full of interesting contradictions.  Early medieval Europe was a world of harsh divisions and hatreds, but it relied on consensus and communal rituals.  Heretics and members of other religions were hated and feared, and yet some thinkers imagined a unified humanity, a dream that remains unrealized.  The expansion of Christianity and the emergence of Europe as “Latin Christendom” is one of our main themes.  The rise of new kingdoms and empires (Capetian France, Anglo-Saxon England, German-Roman Empire) were countered by trends toward separatism and movement (Viking raids, the feudal mutation).  You will become familiar with the basic “story” of the period - the main events and the actors in those events, from the creation of barbarian kingdoms to successive renewals of imperial culture (Carolingian, Ottonian, Holy Roman Empire).  Ecclesiastical culture moved from regional particularity to broader centralized forms, thought of as \"Reform\".  Finally - an important aspect of the course will be our examination of the literary, theological and political traditions of this period of civilizational transformation.",

    "description": "Because the Middle Ages have been the focal point of nationalistic mythmaking in Europe since the early nineteenth century, it is not surprising that, from the earliest days of movies, noted directors have chosen as their subjects both historical medieval events and the great literature of the Middle Ages.  This course is intended to help students appreciate why there is no such thing as “pure” entertainment; to analyse films that purport to represent historical reality or to translate faithfully such medieval epic poems as the Nibelungenlied, instead as primary sources that reveal the culture and temporal moment in which the films’ creators made it.  Beyond augmenting students’ visual literacy, the course will have as its goal developing the tools all historians need to hone: the ability to find the point of view of primary and secondary sources, to recognise how time and culture affect the construction of the past, and how that construction, in turn, shapes particular societies, including our own.",
