We explore the major national developments shaped by slavery, and we also explore the day-to-day experience of everyone whose lives were touched by slavery--women, children, and men who were bought and sold; people, slave and free, who resisted and rebelled against the practice of slavery; people who staked their family's future success on their ability to buy and profit from the purchase of one enslaved person.We begin by exploring the premise that U.S. history, through the aftermath of the Civil War, is at its core the story of slavery. The earliest laws of the American colonies sought to establish a legal practice of slavery; military strategy during the American Revolutionary War attempted to manipulate American investments in slavery; concerns about the rights of slaveholders influenced every major debate over the national constitution; the right to buy and sell other people became a part of how some Americans defined the meaning of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.In the second half of the course, we focus on the experience of enslaved Africans and African Americans, as they forged families and communities, battled for their rights to bodily integrity, created new American cultures, and brought their critique of slavery to the point of rebellion. We explore the impact of slavery on American ideas about race and racial hierarchies, and we consider the development of national conflicts over the practice, morality, and legality of slavery\u2014culminating in the Civil War.\u00a0 We also explore the memory and popular history of slavery.In addition to assigned readings and occasional homework assignments, course requirements include short, in-class quizzes; take-home midterm and final exams; and an eight-page research paper on a topic relating to the history of slavery in the U.S.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=yw_Dussw-jy11WBmMigHBgjR9c-c4dAu&id=841331&ci=170523"},{"courseID":"AFAM:3459","name":"African American Literature Before 1900","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"AFAM","course_num":3459,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course examines some of the pivotal works of late eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century African American literature.

What were the influences of popular culture on the literature of the period? How did the Civil War and the continual threat of lynching affect black creative methods and philosophy? We will also look at the African American literary image created by other American writers such as Stephen Crane, Herman Melville, and Mark Twain, and the legal decisions and political compromises that affected the construction of African American personhood (such as the Dred Scott v.

It surveys the major changes in this region over the 2000 years which preceded the onset of European colonial rule in the late 19th century. Thus it brings the story of African history up to 1880, the point at which European colonialism irrevocably changed the course of African social development. The course focuses on the major dynamics of economic and political change, including the development of states and large systems of trade. A major aspect of this history is the Atlantic slave trade. The course places the slave trade in the wider context of African political, economic and social history, and examines its impact on African societies. The course concludes by discussing the ways in which Africans living under European influence in the early colonial period interpreted their own past.\nThe study of African history has produced a particularly wide variety of views and interpretations.The purpose of this introductory course is to help studentsmake their own judgments about competing claims and conflicting interpretations of the African past. To this end, much of the course is devoted to examining competing interpretations and the evidence on which they are based. It discusses the major arguments which have developed among historians of Africa, and looks at how historians use archaeological, linguistic and documentary evidence. Above all, it discusses historians\u2019 use of African oral tradition. As we will see, one of the most interesting aspects of African historical study is that it draws upon kinds of evidence which are rarely used by historians in other parts of the world, and so gives us an unusual perspective on the human past.

Although the geographic emphasis is the U.S., policies and practices of other countries are discussed for comparison, and international implications of transport change is investigated. It is assumed that students are acquainted in general with institutions and economic relationships in transportation (such as presented in the planning course 102:260), including the government instruments applied to influence market activities in intercity transport. The course builds upon this knowledge to explore recent developments in government investment and promotion practices, such as federal highway cost allocation studies and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\nThe initial portion of the course covers air, highway, and rail transport regulation and the effects of major changes in the economic regulation of those modes. Impacts on service to small communities and to persons with disabilities, the distribution of traffic among the modes, market structure, pricing and price discrimination, and innovation and technological change are discussed. Next students cover safety and environmental regulation, including transport security, environmental impact statements, environmental justice, nonattainment areas, and mitigation measures. An important current topic for investigation is the integration of environmental impact assessment in the transport planning process. In the second portion of the course, students explore finance principles, policies, and operations. Finally, students critically review proposals for change, such as revised transport programs (including state infrastructure banks, block grants, and intermodal trust funds); different methods of infrastructure finance and pricing (including possible roles for intelligent transportation systems); and privatization (including private operation of public facilities, contracts with private firms for facility maintenance, private construction and operation of toll facilities, and public-private partnerships for the joint development of land and transportation).\nStudents have the opportunity and responsibility for active participation in class discussion; each person should appear at class meetings prepared to contribute to a discussion of the week's readings. During the semester students are assigned to write approximately five policy memos, short research reports, or critiques of publications. A final exam is given, either in class at the assigned time, or as a take-home exam; the form is determined following the instructor's consultation with students. Evaluation of students' level of achievement in the course is based on demonstrated performance as follows: discussion and oral presentations (35%), papers and critiques (40%), and final exam (25%).\nAdditional instruction relating to Freight Transportation Planning will be added for students taking the 4 s.h. option.\u00a0\nThere are no textbooks for this class.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=oheeTXm70lAlGUj28W9nJi_NcRa8iJ4V&id=837093&ci=148091"},{"courseID":"GEOG:7000","name":"Geography Colloquium","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"GEOG","course_num":7000,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=R2tiR7in1ehs63yssVBoBpnQkzT3pdi7&id=831242&ci=148094"},{"courseID":"GEOG:7150","name":"Research in Health and Environment","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"GEOG","course_num":7150,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=oENR2NGx5-Fs63yssVBoBjCtfNMxRz94&id=835166&ci=153170"},{"courseID":"GEOG:7550","name":"Research in Spatial Analysis & Modeling","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"GEOG","course_num":7550,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=aqvTdgkKSZZ2QTRC1fjfGuXViknJMnWG&id=835167&ci=153167"},{"courseID":"GEOG:7750","name":"Research in Environmental Policy","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"GEOG","course_num":7750,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=UFSJoOYab7R2QTRC1fjfGi58yI4ejB20&id=835169&ci=153169"},{"courseID":"GEOG:7999","name":"Thesis","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"GEOG","course_num":7999,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=MWV5LUXix6F2QTRC1fjfGjCtfNMxRz94&id=831243&ci=148096"},{"courseID":"EES:1000","name":"First-Year Seminar                                            Tsunamis: Deadly Waves of Destruction","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"EES","course_num":1000,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"A tsunami (Japanese for \"harbor wave\") is formed when a large volume of water is displaced in the ocean, typically by an earthquake.

The Boxing Day Tsunami is one of the largest natural disasters in recorded history. It produced waves 100 feet high that killed nearly 230,000 people in coastal areas throughout the Indian Ocean. The 2011 Tohoku Tsunami was also an unusually large tsunami, with waves up to 40 ft high, more than 19,000 deaths, and destruction of many coastal towns in eastern Japan. This tsunami also cut off power to the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which led to a major nuclear accident. More typical are the Good Friday Tsunami that struck Crescent City, California (289 buildings destroyed, 12 fatalities) and the April Fools Day Tsunami that struck Hilo, Hawaii, ($26 million damage, 159 deaths).

How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth\u2019s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for \u201cHistorical Perspectives,\u201d students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=cmIjktqOzR_TJdrwxmjbgj8SIea0fLjz&id=836219&ci=169294"},{"courseID":"EES:1170","name":"Geology of the U.S. National Parks","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"EES","course_num":1170,"prereqs":[],"hrs":2.0,"Description":"Looking for an interesting elective?\u00a0 One that will enrich your travels, help you understand nature?\u00a0 Most students in this course are not geologists, but most will travel or have traveled to one or more national parks during their lifetime.\u00a0 This course aims to make your trips more interesting by fostering an understanding of why an area was designated as a park, what you are seeing on your visit, how that area formed and how it has changed to be what it is today.\u00a0 It involves well-illustrated lectures about the geology and natural history of selected national parks.\u00a0 For each park outstanding features are emphasized, including those that were prime reasons for putting the area into the park system.\u00a0 These features will be explained in terms of basic geology, landforms, and geologic history, with some discussion archaeology and ecology, depending on the park.\u00a0 Problems in managing our national parks will also be discussed.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=yuzvCi1Bm1jTJdrwxmjbgjOkknQ0jZgB&id=835143&ci=168078"},{"courseID":"EES:1290","name":"Energy and the Environment","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"EES","course_num":1290,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=5shgkyz2uTDHIPPcMdivPCLNcIFn7jMF&id=842604&ci=169252"},{"courseID":"EES:1400","name":"Natural Disasters","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"EES","course_num":1400,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=bZIFczqKCuOCQcBkO0cqlgjgExJAf2fj&id=841022&ci=168065"},{"courseID":"EES:2190","name":"Directed Study","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"EES","course_num":2190,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"This course provides an opportunity to receive academic credit for projects of special interest to undergraduates.

This course will look at the human experience of love, loss, and longing across a wide variety of traditions and time periods. The idea will be to glance into a number of literatures without having to identify a single thread or story among them other than our own responses and reflections. This will be an exercise in reading for better living, in learning a bit about how others have thought about love and loss in order to expand our own ways of seeing the world. There won\u2019t be any books to purchase. The readings will be available online. We will work on paying close attention to short texts through simple readings. Our aim will always be to engage the imagination. There will be a series of shorter written assignments, an oral presentation, and a final written project. Some of the readings will be drawn from the likes of Homer, Sappho (the only ancient Greek female poet we know by name), Plato, the anonymous authors of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, the (also anonymous) early Spanish-language texts known as jarchas, the Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus, the Medieval troubadour poets of southern France, Baroque Spanish and Italian verse, and the writings of the great seventeenth-century Mexican nun Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. We\u2019ll think a bit about different kinds of love, what it means to feel so strongly the presence of something that no longer exists or that is far away, about the nature of life, death, joy, sorrow, that sort of thing.

But, did you know that the idea of a single united Church has never been a historical reality? From the earliest generations, Christians debated and fought over such issues as the exact nature of Jesus, whether or not they had to be Jewish, and even whether it was the teaching or the death of Jesus that brought salvation. In an age of sectarian dispute, how could you know which group had the \u201ctrue\u201d message and path to salvation? Since Jesus wrote nothing himself, authority was sought through his apostles and closest associates. And, since they did not have armies, their battles over authority were waged through narratives. This course will examine these battles over authority by analyzing several of the early Christian gospels, both canonical (e.g. Matthew and John) and non-canonical (e.g. Thomas, Mary, and Judas), paying particular attention to the depiction of Jesus and his apostles. Student grades will be based on attendance and participation, several short reflective and analytical papers, a group project, and a take home exam.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=4rQgYjc7JmKA1kJQKryrZ91NRs5iSp8c&id=839572&ci=162567"},{"courseID":"CLSA:2651","name":"Gender & Sexuality in the Ancient World","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"CLSA","course_num":2651,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course offers a chronological survey of gender and sexuality in ancient Greece and Rome, from the time of Homer to the high Roman empire.

No new taxes.\" - George Bush, 1988. Americans have always held strong opinions about taxes. And well they should. Federal, state, and local taxes now average about 30 percent of Gross National Product. Our objective in this course is to answer several questions about the U. S. tax system: Is it fair? Does it discourage saving? Working? Does it put U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the new \"global\" economy? How can it be improved? Are taxes too high? Answers depend on tax policies in other countries since, in today's highly integrated global economy, the effects of a nation's tax system do not stop at its borders.

This seems to be an important question; indeed it seems to be the question, but philosophers have taken a number of different positions in attempting to answer it. In the first segment of the course, we will consider the issue of whether or not there is a connection between the value of human pursuits and the existence of God and the afterlife. In the second segment we will address the related issue of whether or not the best life is a life of hedonistic self-interest or a life that is guided by a concern for those around us. In the next segment of the course we will consider the Stoic and Buddhist view that happiness is not a matter of making things go as we please but instead is a matter of adjusting to the way that things happen inevitably and on their own. Then we will discuss what some critics have taken to be obstacles in the way of a meaningful life--for example the internet, technology, modernity, and the I-pod. The semester will conclude with a discussion of the prospect that life is just absurd. Philosophers have offered compelling insights on the different sides of these issues, and we will have a lot of discussion to try to sort it all out. Assignments will include study-question assignments, two exams, and active participation in discussion section.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

We look at how to recognize an argument before evaluating it, and Socrates' distinction between sophistry (persuasive techniques) and philosophy (rational argument).

The adjustment, of course, went both ways, and in particular, insights in science suggested and then guided revisions of belief in theology.

We will pay particular attention to Aristotle\u2019s theory of moral knowledge and his response to questions such as the following: what is the nature of moral knowledge and how is it acquired? Is objective moral knowledge even possible? How should we respond to the moral skeptic who argues that it is not? A second major focus will be on Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is concerned with the kind of person you are---just, courageous, moderate with respect to bodily appetites, truthful, generous, friendly----and explains the rightness of right action in terms of such virtuous states of the person. In Aristotle\u2019s view, a virtue is a disposition of the person to act in various ways as opposed to others; such dispositions in the completely virtuous person are crucially integrated into a capacity for both practical reasoning and appropriate emotional response. We will explore how Aristotle thinks virtue is related to human flourishing (or eudaimonia, sometimes translated as \u2018happiness\u2019) and right action, and the manner in which virtue involves aspiring to an ideal. Other major topics will include Aristotle\u2019s account of the various virtues of character; his account of practical intelligence, moral deliberation, voluntary action, choice, and weakness of will; his theory of friendship; his rejection of hedonism and his metaphysically complex theory of the nature of pleasure. Along the way we will also read shorter selections from the Platonic corpus on the nature of moral knowledge, pleasure, and moral psychology, especially where Aristotle is responding to and critiquing the views of his predecessor and teacher Plato. This course is intended for advanced philosophy majors (of sophomore standing or higher) and graduate students.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=rKAAl5u2gY2rCjEAkHbx4OXViknJMnWG&id=838962&ci=168480"},{"courseID":"PHIL:4485","name":"Political Philosophy","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"PHIL","course_num":4485,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Through historical and contemporary readings, we will examine such questions as what, if anything, explains the legitimacy of a state exercising power over the citizens who live within that state.\u00a0 Does it having something to do, for example, with an explicit or implicit contract or agreement among the citizens of a state?\u00a0 Is coercive power, instead, justified by a simply appeal to utility (an appeal to what most benefits people in the long run)?\u00a0 We will also discuss controversies concerning the just distribution or redistribution of resources, the tension between promoting well-being and preserving liberty, and the appropriate use of force by one state against others.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=TG6oQv18S9GrCjEAkHbx4JnQkzT3pdi7&id=839435&ci=168491"},{"courseID":"PHIL:4694","name":"Philosophy of Science","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"PHIL","course_num":4694,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Philosophy of science investigates the foundational assumptions of scientific investigation, such as the nature of scientific explanation and confirmation of theory by evidence, and the relations between theories, between sciences, and between science and society.

We will study key historical and theoretical texts dealing with war and representation, alongside key examples of photography (from the work of Mathew Brady and Robert Capa to amateur photographer-soldiers), literature (Samuel Hynes\u2019 pilot memoir), and film, including Hollywood blockbusters (Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down), traditional, televisual, and experimental documentary (Night and Fog, Burns\u2019 Civil War, Far from Vietnam, the compilation works of Gianikian and Lucchi), government propaganda (Triumph of the Will), animation (Waltz with Bashir), comedy (Chaplin\u2019s Shoulder Arms) and video games (Call of Duty and Battlefield 1).\u00a0 Requirements include reading of all set readings, active participation, attendance at all screenings and classes, 3 mini-exams, one talk, and two essays.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=do_FOOF3UiH723PzLi87Jla3GMSe79FO&id=835744&ci=168649"},{"courseID":"CINE:3750","name":"Topics in Cinema and Culture                                            Special Effects","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"CINE","course_num":3750,"prereqs":["CINE:1601"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Beginning with the consolidation of New Hollywood in the 1970s, and intensifying with the dominance of digital imaging technologies since the 1990s, special effects became a core component of Hollywood film production. Crucial to a range of genres, such as science fiction, action, horror, and even comedy, special effects have also been central to the films of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, David Fincher, and Christopher Nolan. This course will trace the history of special effects from cultural, economic, technical, and aesthetic perspectives. We will address questions like: how do we distinguish \u201cspecial effects\u201d from other technological products, such as widescreen, sound, color, 3D, and high frame rate? What separates these effects from other kinds of spectacles, like chase scenes, musical numbers, and stunts, as well as production design, sets, and makeup? And what is the relationship between \u201cpractical\u201d and digital effects? As the line dividing recorded reality from computer generated animation narrows, a reconsideration of special effects helps raise foundational questions about the status of popular cinema in the 21st century.\nFilms may include: A Trip to the Moon (1902), Metropolis (1927), King Kong (1933), The War of the Worlds (1953), Godzilla (1954), Mary Poppins (1964), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Alien (1979), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), The Fly (1986), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Jurassic Park (1993), The Matrix (1999), King Kong (2005), Zodiac (2008), Avatar (2009), and Life of Pi (2012).\nGrades will be based on a midterm and final paper, participation, a presentation, and a few quizzes.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=29MBW-8bWaP723PzLi87JgjR9c-c4dAu&id=837445&ci=168196"},{"courseID":"CINE:4603","name":"Topics in Contemporary Film                                            Race, Gender, and Sexuality on the Screen","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"CINE","course_num":4603,"prereqs":["CINE:1601"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course will examine intersections of race, gender, and sexuality as represented in American and transnational film and television.

Emerging gaming technologies both draw on cinematic traditions and amplify our embodied experience of scale, heightening both our ability to shrink down and to loom large over the sets and figures that visual narratives comprise. In the near future, emerging VR technology will significantly shift the existing relations of scale among entertainment media and everyday space within the home.\nThis graduate seminar engages with theories of scale in both cinema and wider visual culture. We will read scholarship from a range of disciplines (including literary criticism, film theory, psychopathology, critical videogame studies, and socio-anthropology) and therefore approach questions about scale from multiple vantage points. The syllabus\u2019s core concepts are built around works by Susan Stewart, Mary Ann Doane, Gaston Bachelard, Roland Barthes, and Walter Benjamin. We will read core theoretical works explicitly about cinema and in relation to scale, both as spatial phenomena (e.g., texts about the close-up by Epstein, Aragon, Eisenstein) and in closely related temporal categories (e.g., works on reverie and duration in cinema by Mulvey, Bazin, Deleuze). And we will also apply to the cinema other objects and concepts that engage with scale in different contexts\u2014e.g., art objects like Cornell Boxes (Falcetta, Leppanen-Guerra), or toys and play (Broug\u00e8re) and childhood (Caillois).\nIn this seminar, we will encounter a range of cinematic texts, including documentaries (e.g., Powers of Ten, 1977), CGI-heavy fiction films (e.g., Cloverfield, 2008), animation (e.g., the Secret World of Arietty, 2010; Ponyo, 2008; Alice in Wonderland, 1951), and VR games and cinema (e.g., Golem, forthcoming).

In this sense, native speakers of English already have an instinctive knowledge of its grammar. However, the study of language enables us to externalize and formalize this instinctive knowledge and thus can help us to communicate more effectively. Quite simply, if we know how English works, then we can make better use of it. In short, the study of grammar enables us to go beyond our instinctive, native-speaker knowledge, and to use English in an intelligent, informed way.\nEvaluation will consist of regular homework assignments, two in-class exams, and a cumulative final exam.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis course is a Core Course for the Undergraduate Certificate in Writing.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=4x4O2A811nQIBMwS2N3CSBTTpbfGzDeP&id=834731&ci=170032"},{"courseID":"WRIT:1500","name":"Writing Commons: A Community of Writers                                            The Writer's Life: Generating, Sharing, and Publishing Our Work (A Writing Workshop)","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"WRIT","course_num":1500,"prereqs":[],"hrs":2.0,"Description":"Most writers will agree that in order to be successful they need four basic things: time to create, a group of engaged readers\/editors, a venue to share their work, and coffee.

Readings will include inspiring examples of excellent long-form essays, creative texts, and hybrid literature, as well as interviews with famous authors on the art of writing. (After all, who better to teach you about the writer\u2019s life than the writers themselves?) Through three creatively inspired unit essay assignments (personal narrative, profile, and a hybrid creative project that will ask you to bend and blend genres), you will participate in workshops that will help generate new and inventive writing and provide the opportunity to share work with an intelligent group of like-minded peers. In addition to absorbing large-scale concepts of craft (e.g. dialogue, description, figurative language), you will learn helpful tips and tricks to improve your writing style (e.g. how to thwart punctuation errors, how to improve transitions between paragraphs). You will also gain real world experience with general publishing guidelines by actually submitting your essays to local and national publications. The goal of this class, however, is not to get published. Rather\u2014through close analysis of our individual writing processes, as well as doing the editorial footwork needed to meet the guidelines of established journals and newspapers \u2014you will explore the communities of writing present around you, taking time to realize that to live as a writer you must allow yourself to bring your voice into the larger literary conversation.

But writing is also a way of entering into communities\u2014as participants, observers, cultural critics\u2014and joining in a conversation larger than ourselves. For the purposes of this class, we\u2019ll consider our membership in two distinct but overlapping communities: the local communities in which we each live and work; and the community of the classroom, where we\u2019ll share thoughts and ideas, and strive to nurture each other as writers.\nThis semester we\u2019ll be writing things small and large, planned and spontaneous, raw and revised. In three units, we\u2019ll move from personal reflections to investigations of our surroundings, with plenty of room for exploration and perspective shifting in between. We\u2019ll also read widely, in order to expand our understanding of the literary landscape and to learn by example. As readers, we'll hone our skills at investigating and then articulating what we think a piece of writing is trying to accomplish, what strategies the author has employed toward that end, and whether or not the attempt is successful.\nAttempt is a concept we'll keep in mind throughout the semester, as essai\u2014the root of the word essay\u2014means to try or to attempt. Accordingly, we'll be taking risks in this class. We will write some essays that work very well and some essays that don't work at all. In order to learn from our various successes and failures, we will keep our eyes, ears, and hearts open to the constructive criticism of our peers, and when it is our turn to critique the work of others, we will strive to offer commentary and advice that is lucid, respectful and beneficial to the author.\nThroughout the semester, students will participate in small and large group workshops to help generate new and inventive writing, share\/revise work, and learn general publishing guidelines by submitting polished pieces to local and national magazines. The goal of this class is not to get published, but to develop confidence and strategies for moving forward as writers, readers, and community members.\nCourse Goals\nBy the end of the course, you will have a final portfolio of original work that showcases your writing across a variety of subjects and modes. You will also have a number of works-in-progress and mini essays that you can expand and revise in the future. You will have become a more critical reader\u2014of your own work and that of others\u2014and you will have honed your skills as an insightful, incisive critic.\nNuts and Bolts, or, How The Course Works\nThis class is divided into three units. Unit One asks you to connect an experience of personal significance to a larger cultural or social issue. Unit Two asks you to venture outside of yourself and into your local community to investigate a venue, trend, or tradition. Unit Three asks you to consider the world through the perspective of another person by means of an interview\/profile. For each unit you will write a mini essay (500\u2013750 words) and a larger essay (1200\u20132000 words).\n\u00a0This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

Assignments include weekly writing exercises and a final project in which students apply their new knowledge of style to revise a paper provided by the instructor.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=_JDLoXGjOq0czCRPX96Gqt1NRs5iSp8c&id=835806&ci=168282"},{"courseID":"WRIT:1600","name":"Fast Fixes: Improved Writing in 6 Weeks                                            Paper-Writing Boot Camp: Understand Your Readings and Build Solid Responses","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"WRIT","course_num":1600,"prereqs":["RHET:1040","RHET:1060","RHET:1030"],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"Your papers come back with lower grades than you'd like and comments about areas that need work, but you're not sure how to improve them.

External history deals with non-linguistic events that played a role in the shaping of the English language. Internal history deals with the changes in the grammar (pronunciation, word classes, sentence structure, and vocabulary).You can learn much history through language. For example, the phrase Johnson County Sheriff is loaded with history. Johnson bears testimony to a Danish occupation of England in the 9th century. County, a French word meaning \u2018territory ruled by a count or viscount\u2019, goes back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Sheriff is a truly English word, or rather words, because it comes from shire reeve, a royal administrator of a shire, under Alfred the Great in the 9th century. Shires were replaced by counties by the Normans, but the word still survives in names, for example, (New) Hampshire.We also look at texts and analyze them. You will learn how to read Old English sentences, recite Chaucer in Middle English and read Shakespeare with a 17th century accent. You will discover the reasons why English spelling is irrationally hard; for example, you will understand why the spelling Haus in German makes sense while the spelling house in English does not make sense.Requirements: short homework assignments, two midterm exams and a final exam.Required reading: course pack materials prepared by the instructor.Optional readings: papers on ICON and C.

Through a combination of guided study and hands-on service work, students will create lesson plans, direct activities, and help produce a group publication for a group of young writers at a local school or community center.\nThe course offers three semester hours of credit, broken down as follows. For one hour per week, students will meet in small groups at their chosen community sites to facilitate workshops, lessons, and activities for the youth they\u2019ve elected to serve. The remaining two hours will be spent in class, reflecting on the service experience through group workshops, creative and critical writing, and engagement with theory-driven, pedagogical, and literary texts.\nDrawing on the work of poets, writers, educators, and education activists (including but not limited to Richard Hugo, Kenneth Koch, Georgia Popoff, and Kevin Kumashiro), the course will seek to answer the following questions: How can language serve to empower an individual or community? What is the connection between literacy and social justice? What does it mean to become a community builder, and how can a student most effectively and thoughtfully connect with youth of diverse backgrounds? Special emphasis will be placed on real-world engagement, collaborative learning and leading, sharpening social awareness, and honing practical writing\/communication skills.

Students read and discuss accounts by professional writers, student writers, teachers of writing, and writing researchers. The discipline of composition studies, as well as reflections by writers on writing, is rich with interesting documentation, important theory, and vigorous dialogue. Students write for an audience to read and respond, in a broad variety of genres including the personal essay, the poem, short fiction, short nonfiction, the letter, the one-pager, and an experimental blur of genres. Writing is one tool for working out thinking. It is a link between inner speech and a frame for talk, a link between writer\/speakers and reader\/listeners. It is a writing teacher's responsibility to create an environment that ensures a diet of varied writing and broad reading, a community of rich, specific responders, and lots of opportunities for revising and careful editing. Along with the development of the individual writer-reader, the \"social construction of knowledge\" is an important concept in a writing class, and students experience it in this course. There are no actual stages, there is no specific process, but we can describe and theorize about prewriting techniques, revision strategies, conferencing models, inventories of grammatical conventions and mechanics, and publishing opportunities. Describing writing allows us to freeze the action to discover conditions under which writing takes place, and what the differences are in every writer's approach.

This course is for students with an interest in learning about the Islamic civilization, the religious practices and beliefs, and\/or the history or the regions where Muslims are in the majority.\u00a0 We will examine the traditions and main social and legal institutions of Islam. Arguably, Islam, as a major system of beliefs and practices in the world, affects both Muslims and non-Muslims. Consequently, besides examining the basic tenets, texts, and ideas of the Islamic civilization, this course focuses on the variety of ways in which Muslims and non-Muslims have understood and interpreted Islam. We will review the discussions surrounding the life of the Prophet of Islam, Islamic pre-modern and modern history, the place and role of individuals and society, the legal and economic status of women, and Islamic governments and movements. As a survey course, we will examine these topics through an interdisciplinary approach: we will apply textual, legal\/normative, anthropological, geographical, sociological, analytical, linguistic, and historical methodologies.\u00a0\nOne of the aims of this course is to give voice to Islamic texts and provide a window into how Muslims, in varying socio-historical contexts, view themselves and how they view others. We will address specific topics such as Islamic doctrines and law, philosophy, Sufi mysticism, Islamic science and arts, gender issues, politics, the ongoing debate between modernism and traditionalism in contemporary Islamic societies, and Islam in the West. The course is ultimately an attempt to understand Islam as an idea and as a process, never as a static and crystallized snapshot of the world through the eyes of any specific group inside or outside the Muslim community.\nMinimally, students will learn basic definitions of key terms and concepts, identify major social and political trends, locate demographic and political centers within the Islamic world, understand legal and philosophical norms, contextualize historical events, expose hidden and public tensions within and without Muslim and\/or non-Muslim communities, and acquire a basic understanding of the origins, developments, and limits of the Islamic civilization.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=hK72JJuX6TE3MBgn7UvvyzOkknQ0jZgB&id=836562&ci=155914"},{"courseID":"RELS:1225","name":"Medieval Religion and Culture","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"RELS","course_num":1225,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course explores European religion, principally Western Christianity, and its broader cultural setting from the end of antiquity to the eve of the Reformation (ca. 1500).\u00a0 It examines beliefs and practices among the intellectual and social elite as well as the meaning of religion for the largely illiterate and unlearned majority of the population.\u00a0 Topics also include the role of women, religious opposition, the place of the liturgy, religious art and architecture, politics and religion, and the syncretic blend of \u201cofficial\u201d and folk religion.\u00a0 Three examinations and three short papers.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=Lppwg4UdWgmo8d862M4cAENogOgZq1a8&id=843284&ci=154897"},{"courseID":"RELS:1404","name":"Living Religions of the East                                            Ancestors, Buddhas, Gods, and God","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"RELS","course_num":1404,"prereqs":[],"hrs":null,"Description":"This course will offer an introduction to the ways in which people in Asia bring a broad range of religious ideas to life through practice.\u00a0We will focus on Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Shinto, and various popular religious beliefs; exploring how individuals often participate in a number of different religious practices, even though such practices may belong to several different religious and philosophical systems. \u00a0 We will also discuss the more recent influx of Christianity in Asia and the impact it has had.

How this point is exploited is examined in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilych,\" Clarke's Childhood's End, the Book of Ecclesiastes, the E'numa E'lish, and Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nUpon completing this course, students should be able to (a) reflect on how various quests for meaning in life as expressed in literature relate to the human condition, with particular attention to matters relating to the table, the bedroom, and the grave; (b) specify the dangers in making generalizations about biblical texts and the individuals and groups that hold them to be sacred; (c) indicate how fundamental human questions such as \"Where do we come from?\", \"Where are we going?\", and \"How long do we have?\" are expressed from the contrasting viewpoints of the pagan and biblical visions.\nIn addition to reading materials and interactive tools, online content includes audio slideshows and video (recorded class lectures of Professor Jay Holstein); evaluation consists of one writing assignment and online assessments by way of multiple-choice quizzes, midterm, and final exams, all of which are accessed in the ICON course management system.

In an age of sectarian dispute, how could you know which group had the \u201ctrue\u201d message and path to salvation? Since Jesus wrote nothing himself, authority was sought through his apostles and closest associates. And, since they did not have armies, their battles over authority were waged through narratives.

Religious economics is a related subject sometimes conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious principles to evaluate economic perspectives and practices. In Economics of Religion, we will draw on these and other emerging areas of inquiry to explore the origins and functions of religious economic ideas in Islamic, Christian, and Jewish societies throughout history.\n\u00a0\nSpecifically, after the financial crisis of 2008, scholars paid more attention to the role of religion in sustaining economic development and inspiring financial institutions to offer religion-compliant products and services. Limits on interest-based loans to the growing Muslim community in Western societies forced many banking and investment organization to create shari`a-compliant products and services. The success of Islamist governments in Turkey and Iran to create thriving middle and entrepreneurial classes brought to focus the relationship between religious belief and economics. Globalization, too, played a significant role in raising the profile of religion-inspired financial endeavors, services, and products. Students will be introduced to these and related themes in this highly multidisciplinary course.\n\u00a0\nThis course is about the origins, functions and impact of Islamic and other religions' ideas and practices in the realms of economic development, financial services and products, business ethics and practices, and business models. Students will explore the ways such ideas and practices affect legacy issues like property rights, poverty, and access to healthcare, education, and social security. Lastly, students will examine the impact of religious ideas and practices on social justice matters that touch on individual and group identity along class, gender, ethnicity, and race, as well as, the role of religion in formulating public policy and directing international relations.

Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with\u00a0a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=XLic4cwwpqfYJ1qQ4-wLdUNogOgZq1a8&id=836553&ci=158306"},{"courseID":"RELS:3644","name":"Gandhi and His Legacy","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"RELS","course_num":3644,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course provides an in-depth introduction to the life, ideas, and ongoing impact of one of the most influential activists and thinkers of modern times\u2014Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869 - 1948).

Our primary emphasis is on the characters of Star Trek and how their development illustrates themes related to the future, technology, sexuality, race, gender, and the nature of what it means to be human. Creator Gene Roddenberry\u2019s original concept of the show as a \u201cWestern in Space,\u201d combines elements of campy science fiction, existential conflict, and progressive social thought to portray humanity\u2019s best and worst traits.

Over the course of the semester, students will conduct fieldwork at music festivals,\u00a0open mic nights, music worship services, and jam\u00a0sessions around town, in addition to leading face-to-face discussions with significant\u00a0contributors to Iowa City\u2019s musical culture, such as\u00a0local musicians, and directors of local arts organizations. Seminar discussions will focus on developing critical understandings of the nature of live music\u00a0as a social experience and its significance for community development and sustainability. Students will be evaluated on class discussion, presentations of fieldwork activities, and a\u00a0final essay\/project, which will include a presentation of\u00a0their own contributions to Iowa City\u2019s live music culture. No musical training is necessary for full participation in this course.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=96DHd_FRk4QN1qUc5xuDcR01o3BB_hSW&id=837804&ci=160107"},{"courseID":"HONR:1300","name":"Honors First-Year Seminar                                            Bicycles, Kayaks, and Snowshoes: Writing About Travel","college":"University College","department":"HONR","course_num":1300,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"We will be armchair-traveling to places all over the world that many of us may never in our lifetimes visit.

Through the readings and discussions, this course will help develop the cultural sensitivity so important for those studying at an international university and preparing to enter a global community. Tales of physical exertion and discomfort will challenge our notions of travel, leisure, and endurance. Discussions of readings will emphasize how a traveler\u2019s perceptions of people and places are influenced by cultural values, by gender, race, and class, as well as by travel conditions such as climate, means of transport, and the traveler\u2019s mental and physical preparation.

The overwhelming scientific explanation, contrary to what is sometimes reported in the popular press, is that human actions are a primary factor in causing climate change. Climate scientists explain what is happening to the planet. It takes psychological scientists to offer explanations into why people behave the way they do, even when the consequences of their behavior can be dire for their future. It takes psychological scientists to offer practices for changing behavior. In this seminar, we will apply basic principles of psychological science to observe and explain how human behaviors contribute to climate change and unsustainable practices. Topics will include the thinking patterns, or \u201cheuristics,\u201d from cognitive psychology that make us less than rational decision makers; the influence of groups on the individual, studied by social psychologists, in which groups influence one\u2019s attitudes and behaviors; and the best practices for behavioral change based on principles of learning. The seminar will involve field visits to observe and experience sustainable behaviors in practice, such as helping with prairie seed collection, visiting a sustainable energy production site, or visiting a local sustainable-practices farm.

Many paleontologists - scientists who study life of the geological past - were drawn to the field by pictures of dinosaurs. But how much do these reconstructions accurately reflect what we believe the past was like, and how much do they reflect the time of the artist? How deeply have they been affected by cultural metaphors? How do they influence public perception of science and scientists? And how would you depict the distant past? Paleontology - the study of life of the geological past - gives us a unique opportunity to examine the interaction between science and popular culture. This seminar will take advantage of this opportunity by looking at artistic expressions of past life.

Tolkien as the creator of one of the most imaginative, gripping, and self-contained fictional worlds, \u201cMiddle-Earth,\u201d the setting of his novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Many do not know that he benefited for nearly 20 years from a lively group of friends who met weekly at a pub in Oxford, England, to discuss literature and read their works in progress. This literary club was called the Inklings, and it counted among its members other celebrated writers including Charles Williams and C. S. Lewis, author of The Chronicles of Narnia.\nThis First-Year Seminar is dedicated to exploring the works of Tolkien in the context of the friendships and conversations among the Inklings and in the larger political, social, and religious contexts of the 1930s and 1940s. We will read and discuss Tolkien\u2019s fiction and essays alongside accounts of the Inklings and their discussions and ideas. Along the way we will ask several interrelated questions: how did Tolkien influence the fantasy literature of the twentieth century? Why were ancient myths and poems like Beowulf so important to him, and why did he feel myth and fantasy were so important for modern readers? What role did his friendships and the political contexts of the two World Wars play in shaping Middle-Earth? What is the role of friendship in artistic creation and literary enjoyment?\nGrades in this seminar will be based on leading a class discussion on one of our readings, on lively participation in discussion each week, and on various components of a brief research paper which will be read at our final conference, \u201cMiddle-Earth and the Inklings: Celebrating the Worlds of J.

Subsequent volumes continued to mesmerize readers, and soon thereafter they listened to audio versions and watched cinematic adaptations. Why was the Harry Potter series so appealing? What was it about Harry\u2019s story or that of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Dobby, or Neville Longbottom\u2019s that resonated with such a diverse populace? How and why did readers develop deep personal connections to the series? How was Pottermania created and sustained?\nIn this course we will analyze the Harry Potter series for the insights it provides on friendship, loyalty, finance, the law, social justice, ethnicity, social media, sports (Quidditch), music (The Weird Sisters), and our relationship with animals and their world. Through a close reading of the novels we will consider their place in the literary canon. We will also pinpoint where influences from this canon can be found in the novels. Finally, we will study the Harry Potter series as a cultural phenomenon.

With\u00a0digital media, the public\u2019s demand for around the clock real-time news has skyrocketed. Over the past twenty years newsroom staff has declined by nearly 40% according to Pew, but there has been a dramatic increase in how much is written about leading 2016 presidential candidates. Donald Trump has received nearly\u00a0three times more\u00a0media attention than his opponents, equivalent to $2 billion in free media coverage, compared to $746 million for Hillary Clinton and $321 million Bernie Sanders (based on a company that uses advertising ratings to assign a dollar to the media coverage candidates receive). This is hybrid media. Trump\u2019s Twitter campaigning generates tremendous coverage by both traditional journalists and digital only media outlets, and then is consumed by readers online who want streaming news around-the clock and televisions viewers. There is blurring of digital and traditional media and a feedback loop between the two.\nThis course is about the media and politics. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, and most Americans believe that a free press is an essential condition for both liberty and democratic politics. The\u00a0media play a central role in American politics, not only in setting the agenda of topics that Americans think about and discuss but also in swaying public opinion on political issues and politicians. The course surveys the role of media in U.S. and global politics with a focus on social media. It includes two midterm exams and one take\u00a0home final.\nIn the twenty-first century information access and participation in society are increasingly digital, as news, jobs, education and politics moves online. Interactive online networking platforms such as Twitter, Facebook--are transforming politics from electoral campaigns, to democratic protests, to the news media. Social media is how many\u00a0people find the news and get informed. What are the consequences of this fundamental change in media for politics and society?\u00a0\nTopics include inequality in access to the Internet (the \"digital divide\"), hybrid media and politics (from the New York Times to Wikileaks), social media and Twitter, big data and electoral campaigns, political participation, organizing, social movements and netroots, democratic protests, security and privacy and more.\u00a0\nPolitics is about power.\u00a0Political actors who use traditional and digital media to their advantage gain power, while those less effective at the new hybrid media lose out. While social media has many benefits, it also had costs, including replicating\u00a0societal inequalities based on race and economic class, privacy and security, and reduced tolerance for others.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

Numerous states adopted women\u2019s suffrage at the turn of the 19th Century, for example, decades before the federal government allowed women to vote.\u00a0While the past thirty years have seen an unprecedented resurgence of the states in political power, policy responsibility and institutional capacity, the states have been critical in the U.S. from the beginning of the republic. Indeed, the very name of our nation indicates the pivotal place of the states in its governance. A goal of this course to introduce you to the study of politics in the American states in the 21st Century. \u00a0\nThroughout the course we will use the comparative method, comparing politics and policy across states to understand what causes this variation.

In this class, we'll uncover the history of Congress, how congressional elections shape what legislators do, how laws are made in Congress, the rules and maneuvers that shape these laws, and the future of Congress as one of the major institutions of American government.

Russia has been assertive in various ways and tried to play the role of a great power, despite operating from relative economic, military and diplomatic weakness. The need for a carefully crafted policy on Russia is strong, and U.S. leaders are divided about what that policy should be. Any sensible policy must rest on understanding how Russians themselves see the world and what influences their decision making.\nThe goal of the course is for students to master core knowledge about Russia and its external behaviors and to practice using that knowledge to interpret Russian foreign policy. Students begin by investigating four sources from which Russia\u2019s foreign policy springs: what they understand their national interests to be; their national identity as shaped by their history; the politics that produces their policies; and the capabilities Russia has to influence external events. The course then turns to case studies of Russian policy toward the United States, China and the near abroad (the former Soviet republics along Russia\u2019s borders such as Ukraine).\nUnderstanding Russia\u2019s international behavior can benefit all future citizens and should be particularly valuable for those who will go into government service, the non-profit sector, journalism, the military, or international business.

Most of all, we will strive to become better advocates for our own essays, short stories, and poems, leaving the course able to sharply and smartly articulate our artistic sensibilities to potential readers and editors. This course will include hands-on editorial exercises involving pitching, soliciting, and managing a publication, and will conclude with the production of a literary journal composed of student work.\nInstructor:\u00a0Micah Fields is from Houston, Texas.

In what way do we truly find access another person? We will explore the various ways writers have interpreted the idea of the literary self-portrait, from work that seems invite the reader\u2019s direct gaze, to sketches of others that actually end up revealing far more about the writer herself. As we read such writers as Thomas De Quincey, Natalie Diaz, Plutarch, Jo Ann Beard, Montaigne, Alison Bechdel, Virginia Woolf, Marguerite Duras, Joseph Mitchell, James Baldwin, and Zora Neale Hurston, we will be looking to their various interpretations of portraiture to help guide our own writing.

Students read and discuss accounts by professional writers, student writers, teachers of writing, and writing researchers. The discipline of composition studies, as well as reflections by writers on writing, is rich with interesting documentation, important theory, and vigorous dialogue. Students write for an audience to read and respond, in a broad variety of genres including the personal essay, the poem, short fiction, short nonfiction, the letter, the one-pager, and an experimental blur of genres. Writing is one tool for working out thinking. It is a link between inner speech and a frame for talk, a link between writer\/speakers and reader\/listeners. It is a writing teacher's responsibility to create an environment that ensures a diet of varied writing and broad reading, a community of rich, specific responders, and lots of opportunities for revising and careful editing. Along with the development of the individual writer-reader, the \"social construction of knowledge\" is an important concept in a writing class, and students experience it in this course. There are no actual stages, there is no specific process, but we can describe and theorize about prewriting techniques, revision strategies, conferencing models, inventories of grammatical conventions and mechanics, and publishing opportunities. Describing writing allows us to freeze the action to discover conditions under which writing takes place, and what the differences are in every writer's approach. To teach writing, you need to see that the act of writing is different with each piece you write, that you contribute to the next piece you write with each piece you read.\nEnglish majors may apply this course to the following area and\/or period requirement.

This has been especially true in the world of literary nonfiction where voice is shorthand for aesthetic or rhetorical artistry. Yet written texts don\u2019t really have voices. They may be teeming with stylistic codes, but those are quiet things. In the silence of the printed word, voice is at best a trope for the formal construction of a work across different stylistic registers. Not so in the case of radio where voice means vocalization, where words sound off. When an essay learns how to speak, when it has a real \u201cvoice,\u201d what can it say? In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore voice quite literally as an acoustic event by experimenting with three modes of radiophonic nonfiction\u2014narrative, essayistic, and documentary (students will complete projects in two out of three of these genres). Along with a good deal of revising, we will do close readings and critiques of student work, in both written and radiophonic form, as well as read and listen to selected radio essayists and sound artists. Each student\u2019s written and studio work will receive at least two formal workshops over the course of the semester.\u00a0The goal of this class is to help you discover, develop, and strengthen your capacities as a writer of artful nonfiction that is as compelling to the ear as to the eye.

Given that intimacy typically signals close proximity\u2014 both emotionally and physically\u2014 this is unsurprising. Such proximity also suggests a kind of sharing, of knowledge in particular, which in turn breeds intimate relations. In this course, we will explore the various ways in which intimacy functions as a kind of knowledge about peoples and bodies in relation to one another. Broad questions we will investigate include: How and when do we mark an experience as intimate? Who gets to have certain kinds of intimate experiences, but not others? Where is intimacy permissible and where is it not? What other modes of being in relation can be claimed as intimate? Can fear, shame, and anxiety be counted as felt states of intimacy? On a smaller scale, this will include investigating the reading experience itself as one that generates a kind of intimate knowledge: about ourselves and potentially about other people, too. In turn, we will work through the process of writing as a kind of intimate exchange between ourselves as writers and the texts we read. Speaking in a practical sense, one of main goals will be to improve our reading and writing skills by thinking critically about what writers put on a page and the effects of those choices.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRequired Texts, available at Prairie Lights:\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale 978-0385490818\nDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely 978-1555974077  Winesburg, Ohio 978-0140186550","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=0fFqLAndHu-JxtbCCPp33d1NRs5iSp8c&id=831844&ci=149065"},{"courseID":"ENGL:1200","name":"The Interpretation of Literature                                            Transgressive Literatures","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":1200,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course will examine literatures\u2014short fiction, novels, essays, drama, and poetry\u2014whose protagonists\/speakers\/narrators engage in illicit lifestyles to perpetrate various acts of transgression, which, according to Rene Chen of the New York Times, tend to explore divergent behaviors such as:\n\u201cincest and other aberrant sexual practices, mutilation, the sprouting of sexual organs in various places on the human body, urban violence and violence against women, drug use, and highly dysfunctional family relationships, and that is based on the premise that knowledge is to be found at the edge of experience and that the body is the site for gaining knowledge.\u201d \u00a0\nWithin this context, we will engage the humane versus the profane, and how likewise dichotomies exist to challenge our historical biases within a culture of evolving paradigms.\n\u00a0\nCourse requirements include informal reading responses, two essays, two exams, active class participation, and a final portfolio.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=1gJ1qc65_l7C4vjP0nHF1vS14lRMWZ5v&id=838160&ci=149065"},{"courseID":"ENGL:1200","name":"The Interpretation of Literature                                            The Politics of Perception","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":1200,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Are human beings capable of perceiving the world the way it really is, or are we under the influence of some kind of delusion?

Historically, World War I churned up an undercurrent of fragmentation, where the horrors of warfare filtered back into societal consciousness. Writers and poets addressed the broken body not only in subject but also in literary technique. From there, the body faced further fragmentation in an era filled with issues related to the rights, representations, and reconceptualization of the body. Writers and poets continued to challenge the boundaries, conventions, and rules that governed and affected different bodies, utilizing the book and its body as a means for experimentation.\nThis course will explore the body of text and the body in text, examining the ways in which writers have historically engaged with material and physical representation, as well as how they have challenged notions of agency, performance, unity, and autonomy. Through historical relationships, avant-garde poetics, and theoretical concepts like assemblage, we will consider the body as material, technique, and subject. Ultimately, we will consider how literature has imagined or projected the body as a response to social or political conditions. \u00a0\n\u00a0Required Texts, at Prairie Lights Bookstore:\n\nMargaret Atwood,\u00a0The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u00a0[Anchor\/Doubleday, ISBN 978-0385490818] $15.95\nClaudia Rankine,\u00a0Don\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely\u00a0[Graywolf Press, ISBN 978-1-55597-407-7] $16\nAnne Carson,\u00a0Antigonick\u00a0[New Directions, ISBN 9780811222938] $11.95","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=r6dBL70SL_wQP3M1IiuAmnAm4AbKQSK3&id=831874&ci=149065"},{"courseID":"ENGL:1200","name":"The Interpretation of Literature                                            Otherness and Community","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":1200,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"In this course, we will be exploring literature through the theme of \"Otherness and Community.\" Each of the works we will discuss deals with people who are \"different.\" Our discussions will address to what extent difference enables or hinders community.

In order to be a such a society, it is imperative to study those things which threaten such ideals and the work that is required in order to maintain them. Tyranny and oppression can vary in scope from the personal to the whole of society and all levels in between. The shining beacon casts many shadows, and in those shadows tyranny is nurtured and oppression thrives. Whatever the scope of these ills, it is necessary to learn to recognize them in order to combat them. And in order to combat them, it is important to understand the language of resistance.\nTo better understand systems of oppression and tyranny, and how resistance operates within and around them, we will engage with several literary works exploring several types of oppression, tyranny, and resistance. One of our goals is to read these texts with an aim at understanding how they frame these subjects, their stances, and the language they employ.

AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies. PERIOD: 20th\/21st century literature for Fall 2017.\nIn a June 1959 Playboy article titled, \u201cThe Origins of the Beat Generation,\u201d Jack Kerouac defined the modern Beats as wise men of few words, accompanied by women of fewer, writing: \u201cThe \u2018cool\u2019 (hipster) today is your bearded laconic sage, or schlerm, before a hardly touched beer in a beatnik dive, whose speech is low and unfriendly, whose girls say nothing and wear black.\u201d Traditionally, critics have understood the position of women within the Beat community as peripheral, marking the literary \u201cboy gang\u201d of writers as a self-sustaining homosocial artistic community. For many years, with the notable exception of Diane di Prima, few women writers gained recognition as part of this literary movement, but in recent decades, memoirs by Beat women have spurred feminist recovery efforts to set the record straight. In this course, we will consider the place of these women writers within the Beat canon. We will first begin the semester by defining \u201cBeat\u201d together, focusing on work by foundational Beat writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. Next, we will turn to memoirs written by the women of the Beat Generation to consider the role of this genre within reconstructions of the Beat canon. Finally, we will examine fiction and poetry by these women writers, thinking about how our definitions of \u201cBeat\u201d change by broadening the term to encompass these works, as well as drawing connections between these writers\u2019 aesthetics and stories.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=4SlpMYzHXQuv3VY2Jh5jvmlIsIVeWhWC&id=843160&ci=154538"},{"courseID":"ENGL:2309","name":"Selected British Authors Before 1900                                            William Wordsworth","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":2309,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Author of some of the best-loved poems in English, the Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850) became a true literary celebrity in his day, drawing both fawning adulation and some of the most vicious reviews imaginable.

We'll weave in and out of their work, discussing ways they responded to key nineteenth-century events (like the Civil War, developing technology, changing notions of science and religion, women's rights movements) and ways they challenged orthodox notions of writing poetry, of configuring gender, and of projecting America's future.

AREA: Transnational Literature and Postcolonial Studies. PERIOD: 20th\/21st-Century Literature for Fall 2017.\nEver since the first media reports about a then still unknown disease began to circulate in the 1980s, HIV\/AIDS has captured the imagination of writers and filmmakers. Not only has the illness redefined our understanding of gender and sexuality but\u2014as a sexually transmitted disease\u2014HIV\/AIDS has also required us to examine cultural taboos and stigmas. Short stories and novels, feature films and documentaries can help us better comprehend the psychological, cultural, political and historical dimensions of a pandemic that continues to influence life in the twenty-first century.\nIn this class, we will focus on how African writers and directors have imaginatively engaged with a medical disease such as HIV\/AIDS. To what extent do their stories expose and manipulate the stigma and prejudice associated with a sexually transmitted disease? What populations appear especially vulnerable to the disease and its social and economic consequences? How are local communities and governmental institutions involved in shaping responses to HIV\/AIDS? How is a medical disease metaphorically appropriated to serve as a general symbol for the challenges of modern life? While this class emphasizes African stories about HIV\/AIDS, we will also have an opportunity to reflect on the situation of HIV-positive populations in the United States and engage in a dialogue with people living with the disease.\nCourse requirements include regular attendance and active participation, a portfolio with responses to the assigned materials, one short paper and a final (critical or creative) project.

Sometimes these needs were met by\u00a0so-called \u201csoft\u201d science fiction, based around social rather than empirical sciences, and sometimes this meant classic storylines given a new twist--alien encounters defined less by technological differences and more by psychological ones, the colonization of planets complicated\u00a0less by\u00a0resource concerns\u00a0and more by\u00a0ethical ones.

By cutting across traditional literary periods the course opens new perspectives on four poetic careers as they took place over time and in history.   The goal of the course is to study four poetic careers as they unfold in specific political contexts: Spenser's celebration of Queen Elizabeth and her Irish policies; Jonson's status as a remnant of Elizabethan culture and publicist for the Stuart myth; Marvell's experimentation with various poetic styles, culminating in a densely allusive topical satire; and Dryden's attempts to shape public opinion and follow the migrations of power throughout his life.\u00a0\nRequirements include two papers (50%); two quizzes (10% each); an in-class presentation (10%); attendance and participation (20%)\nRequired Texts\u00a0\n\nR.O.

As the story goes, Shakespeare heard of the rendezvous and usurped Burbage\u2019s place with the punchline that \u201cWilliam the Conqueror was before Richard III.\u201d This apocryphal story shows how strangely seductive the character of Richard III was, despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014his unrelenting evil, manifested in his disfigured body. As the recent global media frenzy over the rediscovery of the historical Richard\u2019s skeleton (buried beneath a parking lot) shows, Richard remains an undeniably attractive figure for us. Indeed, audiences and readers continue to be drawn to the greatest villains in Shakespeare\u2019s works.\nThis course will attempt to explain our ongoing fascination with Shakespeare\u2019s villains by defining, re-defining, and upending our notions of what constitutes villainy. Characters like Richard III and Iago have long embodied and epitomized the Shakespearean villain\u2014but the role of the villain, and even the term \u201cvillain,\u201d were far more complicated. As such, we will focus not only on plays that feature famous villains, but on unexpected plays that will force us to reconsider what villainy meant for Shakespeare\u2014and what it continues to mean for us.\nWe will spend much of our time reading the plays closely and critically, in order to become both familiar and comfortable with reading Shakespeare\u2019s dynamic language. We will also learn about the professional theatre in which Shakespeare worked, and in which his plays were first staged, as well as the ways these plays have been performed, altered, and adapted over the subsequent centuries. We will encounter and use supplementary readings, online resources, and film versions that contextualize and galvanize the plays.\nCourse requirements will include active engagement in class discussion; a series of short exercises and writing assignments; and an individual critical or creative project. Readings will include Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Macbeth.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=wD5JmPyCyOYzUECtnBIVC7XZMu7NiOk4&id=836640&ci=154512"},{"courseID":"ENGL:3339","name":"Literature & Culture of 19th Cen Britain","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":3339,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"The nineteenth century was an era of major changes in British life--in industry, science, education, transportation, technology, women\u2019s roles, and political inclusion.

We will, of course, read the novel ourselves, and then we will use our resulting conversations (e.g., Are Democrats and Republicans not that different after all? Does great writing transcend ideology?) as a springboard for surveying subsequent classic (e.g., Catch-22, The Things They Carried, In Country) and contemporary (e.g., Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk, Sand Queen, Sparta, War Porn) American writing about war. Our primary focus will be fiction, but we certainly won\u2019t rule out making brief excursions into nonfiction and poetry to broaden our understanding of the forms that this writing takes.

Together we will work on focusing your topic, developing a research strategy, building an annotated bibliography, and, most significantly, generating and evaluating substantial portions of the thesis itself. Because this is a workshop, we will emphasize collaborative thinking and productive comments. Class meetings will provide a place to test ideas, refine arguments, debate the results of research, even get a clue from others who want to help. Everyone is expected to come prepared to participate.\nOur conversations are designed to supplement ongoing work with your adviser, who will also want to respond to the material submitted for workshop discussion. Be sure to request such responses regularly over the course of the term. Those planning to graduate in December will complete the thesis and should naturally get an adviser\u2019s feedback along the way. Those planning to graduate in May will produce a substantial portion of the thesis by the end of the semester and should have steady and specific advice on how well things are going. While advisers, second readers, and the Honors Committee will be the final judges, your thesis will also receive a grade for this workshop after a revised draft is submitted.\nWriting an honors thesis is the most challenging work you are likely to do as an undergraduate\u2014and the most exhilarating. Sharing the process with a community of informed and supportive readers prompts a kind of synergy, collaborative ideas beyond what one or two people manage alone. Engaged discussion often produces writing that is unexpectedly passionate, insightful, and venturesome, especially as a thesis changes and matures. What makes this workshop genuinely valuable, certainly for those who are considering graduate studies, are the conversations that develop as the semester unfolds and the growing sense that your writing deserves to be read.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=k1884-XP6bC5EI7o8G8aDrgdciy0mWMU&id=836382&ci=151037"},{"courseID":"ENGL:4040","name":"Undergraduate Honors Project","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":4040,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=36YMJBLqDjsbs8c5e5BrR-XViknJMnWG&id=830457&ci=146787"},{"courseID":"ENGL:4150","name":"Introduction to Book Studies                                            Benjamin Franklin's Old Media","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":4150,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies and PERIOD: 18th\/19th-Century Literature.\u00a0\nFor UICB students, this course counts toward the\u00a0Scholarly Inquiry\u00a0area.\nThis course will explore notions of authorship, publishing, and reading in early America by way of the endlessly fascinating character of Benjamin Franklin.

Another and perhaps more interesting way they coincide, to be explored in this class, is that they are all either structuralist or poststructuralist.

There are also the works of Shakespeare: the poems and plays that first earned him a reputation that, like those poems and plays, would be made and remade, adapted and amended for centuries to come. Then there is \u201cShakespeare,\u201d a cultural icon and a global phenomenon (not to mention a successful brand).

We will spend much of our time situating Shakespeare and his works in the context of early modern England, focusing on the theatre industry in which he worked, the political and religious debates in which he intervened, the burgeoning literary culture in which he wrote, the marketplace of print that made his fame, the textual environment in which he existed (and was transformed), and the subsequent critical industry that he continues to both inspire and authorize. We will engage closely with the poems and plays, along with a wide range of critical and historical material. In addition, we will use many of the powerful digital tools that now exist for the study of Shakespeare and his age. As such, this course will also provide an introduction to early modern studies\u2014to the major issues at stake, and more importantly to the potential of what is one of the most exciting (and technologically sophisticated) areas of literary study. The goal is to engage with a variety of approaches that will strengthen and enrich your own research and teaching.\nThe course requirements will include a variety of short research and writing assignments, culminating in a paper suitable to be delivered at a conference.

Throughout the semester, as we draft our own sequence or long poem generated in response to our readings and discussions, we will ask ourselves, as writers, how far is far enough? Part seminar\/ part workshop\/part long poem support group, this course welcomes all curious writers of poems, prose poems, and hybrid artists intrigued by stamina.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=Zw0tO0vhtl7L1FZgSD3-xrgdciy0mWMU&id=839525&ci=170601"},{"courseID":"ENGL:6950","name":"Colloquium: Foundations of the Major","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENGL","course_num":6950,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"This course is a practicum for TAs teaching the discussion sections of Foundations of the English Major.

Williams, Elizabeth Bishop, Rita Dove, Lorna Dee Cervantes) to make us feel justified at being anything less than as omnivorous in our approach.\u00a0 Along the way, as well, we will gain some familiarity with several theorists whose work is commonly cited by humanities-oriented food studies scholars (Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Douglas, Bourdieu, Appadurai, and others), and we\u2019ll explore the wonderfully rich but under-utilized Louis Szathmary Culinary Archive, a gift to the University of Iowa from the estate of the Hungarian-born and later Chicago-based celebrity chef and writer Louis Szathmary, \u00a0\nThe class being a seminar, all students will develop a major project.\u00a0 Presumably most will prefer to pursue the traditional option of a carefully researched and lovingly written seminar paper focused on one or more of the texts we have studied in the class, including perhaps material from the Szathmary Culinary Archive.\u00a0 We will equip ourselves with the skills for executing such an assignment through a series of preliminary steps along the way:\u00a0 working in subgroups to identify important and\/or recent scholarship on specific texts, summarizing that scholarship both orally and in writing for classmates, writing a short abstract about your chosen topic, and constructing an annotated bibliography.\u00a0 But I would also be delighted to entertain (do-able-in-a-semester) ideas for innovative and\/or collaborative projects, for instance in the digital humanities or creative writing.\nThe prerequisite for enrollment is that you are a graduate student who likes to think about (and hopefully eat) food.\u00a0 Medievalists, early Americanists, NWP and WW students, historians, anthropologists\u2014all, and more, are welcome to join in.\u00a0 I\u2019ll bring to the table what I know about food writing and food studies, I\u2019ll help us as a class build a relationship with the research librarians who know how to navigate the Szathmary

(MANOVA).\u00a0 The intent is to familiarize students with multivariate methods in such a way that awareness of the foundations of techniques is developed as well as appreciation for practical applications.\u00a0 A major goal of instruction is that students develop a sufficient conceptual foundation in multivariate methods to evaluate literature that uses these techniques as welll as grasp basic ideas behind methods not specifically covered in this course.\u00a0 Because a primary goal of the course is that students understand how multivariate methods work, the use of \"canned\" statistical routines will be avoided in the beginning of the course.\u00a0 Instead, students will be provided with sample computer programs that use matrix routines from SAS's PROC IML, and may use them to perform the more rudimentary techniques in multivariate analysis.\u00a0 This merely uses a computer as a giant calculator; no original programming is required.\u00a0 The examples from IML will be complemented by illustrations from pre-packaged procedures to facilitate interpretation of essential information from PROC GLM and PROC ANOVA.\u00a0 We will use packaged programs in SAS for the

This course will teach that Motivational Interviewing is a style of working with persons with addictive behavior disorders designed to increase motivation for change. This course will teach students to match interventions to six stages of readiness-for-change. It will emphasize motivational strategies that include how to help the client\/patient resolve ambivalence impasses that impede change, how to draw upon internal motivation to work in a positive direction and how to remove obstacles to change. A combination of lecture, readings, videos, large and small group discussion will be used to advance students knowledge and understanding of Motivational Interviewing. In addition, heavy emphasis is placed on classroom discussion and role-play activities\nClass Attendance Policy: students are expected to attend class.

In Florence, we will view the greatest collection of Italian Renaissance art in the world at the Uffizi Gallery, walk over the Ponte Vecchio, and see Michelangelo\u2019s David, as well as Santa Maria del Fiore (Duomo). In Venice, we will cruise the cities canals and learn about its unique history. During our visit to Rome, we will walk through the Roman Forum, Vatican Museums, St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and Coliseum. Our trip will end in Barcelona, where we will see La Sagrada Familia, the Barcelona Cathedral, and Gaudi architecture, before hitting the beach.\nOver the course of the semester, you will be introduced to Irish and British English, and learn to say, \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d and \u201cThank you\u201d in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

In this course that is taught exclusively in French, students learn how to refine their pronunciation, strengthen their ability to function in various communicative contexts, handle stylistic variations and idiomatic expressions, and communicate as naturally as possible in the language. Students also learn to use proper grammatical constructions and vocabulary to narrate, describe, compare, convince, or articulate opinions and hypotheses.\u00a0We use samples of oral productions in France and Francophone regions of the world such as the Caribbean, Europe, Qu\u00e9bec, Sub-Saharan Africa, and others in order to emphasize and discuss differences in pronunciation and vocabulary use across French-speaking countries. This exercise also allows students to improve their oral-aural skills in a global French-speaking perspective.\nA special aspect of the course called \u201cBridging the French class with the French-speaking Iowa City community\u201d will focus on the dynamics individual students will generate by actively using their speaking skills to help the Iowa City community. This activity may include for example volunteering as interpreters and translators at Alexander, Wood, and Twain Elementary Schools or at IC Compassion.\nGrades are based upon class participation, attendance, homework, debates, dict\u00e9es, a midterm oral exam, and a video project. Dict\u00e9es are the most complete activity to develop oral-aural and writing skills. They will be given regularly throughout the semester. Debates will focus on the films watched in class and on topics such as: social media; new technologies; cultural differences; social justice; international humanitarian assistance, the environment; climate and political refugees, health care in France and the US; student life and tuition fees in France, the US and Quebec; immigration; etc.\n\u00a0Course materials focusing on films, music, news media (print media, radio and television, and online news) and other visual arts will be made available in class and on CANVAS.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=RqZSygaRC_Zjv2_2SDtQFR01o3BB_hSW&id=830483&ci=146842"},{"courseID":"FREN:4110","name":"Francophone Lit of the African Diaspora                                            The Changing Faces of Sub-Saharan Africa in Literature and Visual Culture","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"FREN","course_num":4110,"prereqs":["FREN:3060","FREN:3300"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"The Changing Faces of Sub-Saharan Africa in Literature and Visual Culture: This course seeks to critically examine literary, cinematic and artistic expressions on Francophone sub-Saharan Africa.

Through readings of works of literature and cultural history, we will aim to get a sense for how members of the court at Versailles defined their own social roles within a rapidly changing society that included new spheres of public and private existence. Authors to be studied will include La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Moli\u00e8re, and Saint-Simon.

The objectives of the course are twofold. First, to study the major works and authors of 19th-Century France in their historical and cultural contexts, focusing on their relationship to literary movements: Romanticism, Realism, the Fantastic and Naturalism. Second, to provide an introduction to literary criticism and theory by reading seminal essays on the analysis of stories, primarily from structuralism and Russian formalism, in order to learn a variety of methodologies for approaching narrative prose.\nIn our discussions, we will ponder some of the following questions: How does theory\/criticism define literature as a category or object of study? How are narratives constructed\u2014what are their elements? How do characters develop? What is the role of description in narrative? What constitutes an action or event, and what forms a plot? How does the focalizer function in direct and indirect discourse? To what extent are scientific or rational discourses adopted or rejected? What is the impact of the Industrial Revolution on literature? How do artistic trends, such as Realist painting, influence literature of this period? How does the rise of modernity, especially the dissemination of technological innovations, transform representations of reality? Finally, to what extent do these narratives conform to the structuralist concepts used to analyze them, and which textual elements resist inclusion in a narratological framework?\nStudents will be required to participate actively in class discussions, write weekly response papers, take three exams, and present an MLA-style paper (10 pages, double-spaced) to the class.

After the Buddha passed away, Buddhist schools proliferated. We will first identify some of the main features of Theravada Buddhism. We will then explore the history and practices of several major Mahayana Buddhist schools, especially esoteric Buddhism and Zen in Japan. In the 1850s, Japanese arts and crafts began to flood European shores and transformed Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. They also entered museums and became a familiar sight across the U.S. today. Little known is the fact that traditional Japanese art was imbued with Buddhist principles. We will examine some of\u00a0the basic\u00a0aesthetic principles and concepts that\u00a0encompass\u00a0Japanese arts and crafts. We will have a quick glance at the Western \"discovery\" of Buddhism and their joint efforts with Asian Buddhists to make sense of Buddhism in scientific terms in the modern period. As a case study, we will review the early history of Japanese Zen in the United States that gave rise to an indigenous American Zen tradition which also influences the Western (Zen) world. Meditation functions at the heart of Buddhist practice. We will take a look at the Dalai Lama's collaboration with contemporary scientists to fathom the extraordinary power of meditation.This general education course breaks down\u00a0into two classes: both are about seventy minutes long, with a\u00a0ten-minute break between the two.

Arguably, Islam, as a major system of beliefs and practices in the world, affects both Muslims and non-Muslims. Consequently, besides examining the basic tenets, texts, and ideas of the Islamic civilization, this course focuses on the variety of ways in which Muslims and non-Muslims have understood and interpreted Islam. We will review the discussions surrounding the life of the Prophet of Islam, Islamic pre-modern and modern history, the place and role of individuals and society, the legal and economic status of women, and Islamic governments and movements. As a survey course, we will examine these topics through an interdisciplinary approach: we will apply textual, legal\/normative, anthropological, geographical, sociological, analytical, linguistic, and historical methodologies.\u00a0\nOne of the aims of this course is to give voice to Islamic texts and provide a window into how Muslims, in varying socio-historical contexts, view themselves and how they view others. We will address specific topics such as Islamic doctrines and law, philosophy, Sufi mysticism, Islamic science and arts, gender issues, politics, the ongoing debate between modernism and traditionalism in contemporary Islamic societies, and Islam in the West. The course is ultimately an attempt to understand Islam as an idea and as a process, never as a static and crystallized snapshot of the world through the eyes of any specific group inside or outside the Muslim community.\nMinimally, students will learn basic definitions of key terms and concepts, identify major social and political trends, locate demographic and political centers within the Islamic world, understand legal and philosophical norms, contextualize historical events, expose hidden and public tensions within and without Muslim and\/or non-Muslim communities, and acquire a basic understanding of the origins, developments, and limits of the Islamic civilization.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=DTV1GFk_zm8T1ar8JChIo6FsMj6MX5YM&id=836562&ci=170540"},{"courseID":"HIST:1040","name":"Diversity in History                                            African American History to 1877: From Slave Cabin to the Senate Floor","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HIST","course_num":1040,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Django Unchained, Twelve Years a Slave, Nate Parker\u2019s Birth of a Nation \u2013 just a glance at recent movie titles reminds us that the history of African Americans in slavery and freedom remains a topic of public interest and debate in the twenty-first century.\u00a0 Although historians argue about how accurately and inclusively these films represent slavery and the slave experience, each film does engage with real aspects of that history.\u00a0 Husbands and wives were separated by the domestic slave trade \u2013 free blacks were kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South \u2013 enslaved men and women resisted in myriad ways, including armed rebellion.\u00a0 This course is an opportunity to learn and understand more about all of the above, while gaining a foundation in early African American history more broadly.African American History to 1877 offers a survey of African American history from African origins and the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade to emancipation and Reconstruction following the U.S. Civil War.\u00a0 Major topics will include the development of a race-based slavery in the North and South; gradual emancipation and the development of a free black community in the North; slave resistance and the black abolitionist movement; growing sectional tensions and the Civil War; and emancipation and new political rights post-1865.\u00a0 This course centers the experiences of free and enslaved African Americans, as well as their contributions to larger national debates about race and slavery in the nation.\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the way that racial and gender ideologies shaped African American men and women\u2019s experiences in slavery and freedom.\u00a0 The course will also consider the ways that African Americans and the history of slavery are portrayed in popular culture and memory, such as the feature films mentioned above.\u00a0 Primary sources, fiction, film and documentaries, and traditional secondary sources will form the basis of our study.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=BTJqdAnljm1IqA5x2ORw6F41ufakJzRM&id=851310&ci=151246"},{"courseID":"HIST:1115","name":"Big Ideas: The History & Science of Oil","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HIST","course_num":1115,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n\u00a0\nAs part of the University of Iowa\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the \u201cAge of Petroleum,\u201d an age in which we continue to live.\n\u00a0\nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years?

We explore the major national developments shaped by slavery, and we also explore the day-to-day experience of everyone whose lives were touched by slavery--women, children, and men who were bought and sold; people, slave and free, who resisted and rebelled against the practice of slavery; people who staked their family's future success on their ability to buy and profit from the purchase of one enslaved person.We begin by exploring the premise that U.S. history, through the aftermath of the Civil War, is at its core the story of slavery. The earliest laws of the American colonies sought to establish a legal practice of slavery; military strategy during the American Revolutionary War attempted to manipulate American investments in slavery; concerns about the rights of slaveholders influenced every major debate over the national constitution; the right to buy and sell other people became a part of how some Americans defined the meaning of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.In the second half of the course, we focus on the experience of enslaved Africans and African Americans, as they forged families and communities, battled for their rights to bodily integrity, created new American cultures, and brought their critique of slavery to the point of rebellion.

Any sustained war effort has important political, social, cultural, and economic implications. It shifts the priorities of political life, recasts the economy around wartime needs, and scrambles the private lives of those at home and abroad. All of this was exaggerated in the case of American participation in World War II. The sheer scale of the war effort brought with it far more profound and lasting changes than the shorter and smaller mobilization of 1917-1919. And, perhaps most importantly, the war came in a time at which the basic direction of American politics, political economy, and political culture was \"up for grabs.\" The Depression which had begun in 1929 still gripped the nation's economy, and the political response to the Depression--the New Deal--had transformed the role of the state in the economy, introduced the first hints of the modern welfare state, and changed the rules and expectations of labor relations. All of these changes were matters of fierce debate when the war came; in some respects the war suspended this debate, but in other respects it resolved it by recasting the New Deal around the assumptions of full employment and increased government spending. As students trace this and other elements of the war experience, they touch on prewar patterns, the impact and importance of the war, and the postwar situation.\u00a0\nNote: this course has proctored online exams.

Thus it brings the story of African history up to 1880, the point at which European colonialism irrevocably changed the course of African social development. The course focuses on the major dynamics of economic and political change, including the development of states and large systems of trade. A major aspect of this history is the Atlantic slave trade. The course places the slave trade in the wider context of African political, economic and social history, and examines its impact on African societies. The course concludes by discussing the ways in which Africans living under European influence in the early colonial period interpreted their own past.\nThe study of African history has produced a particularly wide variety of views and interpretations.The purpose of this introductory course is to help studentsmake their own judgments about competing claims and conflicting interpretations of the African past. To this end, much of the course is devoted to examining competing interpretations and the evidence on which they are based. It discusses the major arguments which have developed among historians of Africa, and looks at how historians use archaeological, linguistic and documentary evidence. Above all, it discusses historians\u2019 use of African oral tradition. As we will see, one of the most interesting aspects of African historical study is that it draws upon kinds of evidence which are rarely used by historians in other parts of the world, and so gives us an unusual perspective on the human past.

Does that spending make us happy? Would doing something different make our lives better? What would we do if we didn\u2019t have to work for a living? Second, we\u2019ll use it to connect to various academic disciplines: What might economists, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers say about money, work, happiness, and the good life?

Spillville and its neighboring town of Protivin, IA, have some of the largest Czech-American populations (by percentage) in the state. Additionally, here in Eastern Iowa, Cedar Rapids has a thriving Czech community and is home to the National Czech and Slovak Museum. Capitalizing on Iowa\u2019s ample Czech heritage, this class aims to introduce students to some of the popular authors of 20th and 21st century Czech literature (English translations), most of which is largely intertwined with Czech history and politics.\n\u00a0\nWriters to be discussed and explored in the course include (but are not limited to) Milan Kundera, Vaclav Havel, Josef Skvorecky, Zdena Salivarova, Karel Capek, Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Klima, Monika Zgustova, and Bianca Bellova. In addition to class lectures, students will read (independently) a Czech novel of their choosing (from pre-approved selections). This course is an opportunity for students of all backgrounds to strengthen their reading, research, and critical analysis skills, as well as learn about the turbulent Czech history of the 20th century. Students will be assessed via class discussions\/participation, short reflection journals, and a final project based on the novel they have read.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=_JT6ZOlstWeXDYypZA95Gbgdciy0mWMU&id=838148&ci=170217"},{"courseID":"ESL:1005","name":"ESL Special Topics                                            Exploring the Civil Rights Movement Through the Arts","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ESL","course_num":1005,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"Example description: Does Art reflect or influence society?\u00a0 The history of the Civil Rights Movement in the middle of the 20th century has been documented in many ways.\u00a0 Authors, poets, and musicians focused attention on inequality in the first half of the century.\u00a0 Playwrights and film-makers contributed to change and continued to document the era after legislation was passed in the 1960s.\u00a0 Students will examine various media and respond through discussion, presentation, and writing.\u00a0 Assessment will be based on class participation, presentations and written work.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=tliBUf6GGNMJ5l4Y2x5z1OXViknJMnWG&id=837687&ci=170217"},{"courseID":"ESL:1005","name":"ESL Special Topics                                            Travel Writing","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ESL","course_num":1005,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"Travel is an important aspect of the human experience.

The earliest ones are presented as historical accounts, often intended to teach moral lessons, while the latest are pure fiction, intended to be read for pleasure and entertainment. We will consider questions related to literary form and intent: what is history, what is fiction, and how permeable is the boundary between the real and the fantastic? The major writing assignments for this course will be creative: students will select and rewrite two of the ghost stories we read, perhaps updating the setting to modern times or moving the story from China to Iowa, changing the ending or other plot elements, transforming or adding characters, making a scary story campy or fun, or giving a happy story a tragic ending or vice versa, and write an essay discussing the changes.

Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with\u00a0a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=8JTGJCpmWwsaoJ7900puIHAm4AbKQSK3&id=836553&ci=170983"},{"courseID":"ASIA:4301","name":"Honors Tutorial","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ASIA","course_num":4301,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=KXmXu7dOyjQkH9sC-ur0eRTTpbfGzDeP&id=834610&ci=147983"},{"courseID":"ASIA:4506","name":"Senior Honors Thesis","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ASIA","course_num":4506,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=0AeRu_xMD3kkH9sC-ur0eSeYtXpT9Iue&id=831194&ci=147984"},{"courseID":"ASIA:4508","name":"Asian Studies","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ASIA","course_num":4508,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=ZguKkd6asy1vmXoHauH0flGWPxZB1Cdo&id=834100&ci=147985"},{"courseID":"ASIA:6483","name":"Second Language Classroom Learning","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ASIA","course_num":6483,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"For students completing the online TEFL Certificate.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

Efficiency in written communication will be our primary goal. The above quote (sometimes called \u2018Einstein\u2019s Razor,\u2019 as it can be read as a counter\/complement to Occam\u2019s Razor), is often paraphrased and\/or misattributed as, \u201cThings should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Curiously, Einstein didn\u2019t follow his own advice when writing his statement. When we write, however, we will always strive to do so. Along the way you will also either learn or augment the following skills: reading comprehension, rhetorical analysis, peer feedback, editing\/proofreading.  As this may be the last writing course you ever take, the intention is to give you as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The semester is broken down into three parts, each focused on writing for specific audiences you will encounter throughout your career, namely: the professional, the public, and the scientific. At the end of the course you will have compiled a portfolio of material that is immediately applicable to the next stage of your professional development.  In the first segment we will cover professional communications and official correspondence, with a focus on job and graduate applications materials (resumes, CVs, personal statements, cover letters, etc.). The second segment will cover science writing for a general audience, in other words, how to communicate what you know about the science world to those who do not share your expertise. Whether the goal is to persuade, inform, support, or refute, the necessary rhetorical elements will be addressed and reinforced. Specific techniques will be taught where needed such as formatting, supporting an argument, or creating a narrative structure for a personal essay, op eds, or article of interest. Finally, the third segment will concentrate on reading and writing in the hard sciences. We will read articles and studies such as those found in Lancet, Science, or the NEJM to break them down for content and structure, and we will develop our own original material in the form of reviews, summations, and critique. Special attention will be paid to methods of gathering, outlining, and drafting information that either illuminates and\/or argues a particular case. A classic Writers\u2019 Workshop structure will be employed, allowing authors to gain and offer written feedback throughout the semester. This course has neither tests nor quizzes. Attendance is required.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=TQNeiNclCaWi7KU9TTtihlGWPxZB1Cdo&id=837976&ci=168989"},{"courseID":"HHP:4010","name":"Behavioral & Clinical Health Assessment","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4010,"prereqs":["HHP:2200","HHP:2310","HHP:1100","HHP:1300"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=fB0Q42sL33WwM2LjISFKGBTTpbfGzDeP&id=837874&ci=169798"},{"courseID":"HHP:4020","name":"Health Communication & Coaching","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4020,"prereqs":["HHP:2200","HHP:2310"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=GMRB-bGPoH2wM2LjISFKGEl4hxQ45GJY&id=839627&ci=169799"},{"courseID":"HHP:4030","name":"Policy, Environmental, & Social Health","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4030,"prereqs":["HHP:2200","HHP:2310"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=TAZLqZ5SULVWOCHtPnh05RTTpbfGzDeP&id=839754&ci=169800"},{"courseID":"HHP:4040","name":"Health Services","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4040,"prereqs":["HHP:2200","HHP:2310"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=MmyW0ByR52FWOCHtPnh05Ul4hxQ45GJY&id=839753&ci=169801"},{"courseID":"HHP:4130","name":"Skeletal Muscle Physiology","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4130,"prereqs":["HHP:3500"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=nd0h0frhKlkBC0ITns6oOvS14lRMWZ5v&id=834886&ci=157858"},{"courseID":"HHP:4200","name":"Metabolic Exercise Testing\/Prescription","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4200,"prereqs":["HHP:2200","HHP:3400","HHP:3500"],"hrs":4.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=QeMqDh36vRh6SPnBbUJrFFGWPxZB1Cdo&id=833789&ci=158006"},{"courseID":"HHP:4210","name":"Musculoskeletal Exercise Test & Prescrip","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"HHP","course_num":4210,"prereqs":["HHP:2200","HHP:3400","HHP:3500"],"hrs":4.0,"Description":"This course provides theory and practical experience for designing resistance training and flexibility programs.

Just as most forms of traditional medical practice have experimented with, and in many cases have established, procedures for enacting healing ritual, religious practice throughout the world has historically included specified prayer and other forms of individual and collective procedures designed to augment the healing process. This includes practices designed not only for what we in the West define as mental or psychological illness, but for physical illnesses of virtually every description. The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with\u00a0a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=zGVwxK7QoiWST9x6TMe7kZnQkzT3pdi7&id=836553&ci=160276"},{"courseID":"GHS:3151","name":"Anthro of Beginnings & Ends of Life","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"GHS","course_num":3151,"prereqs":["ANTH:1101","ANTH:2100"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"When does life begin?

We use the term \u201cgrammar\u201d to mean the system of structural rules which describes how words combine with each other to form sentences. In this sense, native speakers of English already have an instinctive knowledge of its grammar. However, the study of language enables us to externalize and formalize this instinctive knowledge and thus can help us to communicate more effectively. Quite simply, if we know how English works, then we can make better use of it. In short, the study of grammar enables us to go beyond our instinctive, native-speaker knowledge, and to use English in an intelligent, informed way.\nEvaluation will consist of regular homework assignments, two in-class exams, and a cumulative final exam.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis course is a Core Course for the Undergraduate Certificate in Writing.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=-_04jt0TzE7O4cabO3tno1a3GMSe79FO&id=834731&ci=152725"},{"courseID":"LING:1010","name":"Language and Society","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"LING","course_num":1010,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Officially an introduction to sociolinguistics, this course looks at how people use language when they interact with each other. The focus is on dialects of English. You will learn how your way of speaking is different from the way they speak English in, for example, Chicago, Minnesota, Texas, Kentucky, the Boston area, and the east coast states, as well as in England. You will be able, among other things, to characterize the differences between Standard American English and Received Pronunciation, the dialect spoken by the Queen of England.\nFurther, you will discover why you do not understand the earlier forms of English, for example, the English spoken by Geoffrey Chaucer, a 14th century English poet. It will become clear why English spelling is so hard to learn.\nWe will also look at how you vary your language depending on the situation you are in and who you talk to. You will also see how the use of language can tell you about social classes.\nThe course comprises two lectures and one section meeting per week. New content is introduced in the lecture. The section provides an opportunity to enhance your analytical skills. The lecture is taught in an interactive way, whereby the students who wish to work with the instructor provide the data by, for example, pronouncing certain words that are then analyzed in the lecture.

In order to get at answers to those questions, we will survey the diverse forms that human languages may take, and examine some of the underlying similarities.\u00a0 Approaching such a variety of human languages also necessitates developing a vocabulary equal to the task. This vocabulary will indeed allow us to capture the surprisingly small number of ways that languages can differ and how they are alike. We will also survey less technical topics such as writing systems, social registers, and others.

External history deals with non-linguistic events that played a role in the shaping of the English language. Internal history deals with the changes in the grammar (pronunciation, word classes, sentence structure, and vocabulary).You can learn much history through language. For example, the phrase Johnson County Sheriff is loaded with history. Johnson bears testimony to a Danish occupation of England in the 9th century. County, a French word meaning \u2018territory ruled by a count or viscount\u2019, goes back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Sheriff is a truly English word, or rather words, because it comes from shire reeve, a royal administrator of a shire, under Alfred the Great in the 9th century. Shires were replaced by counties by the Normans, but the word still survives in names, for example, (New) Hampshire.We also look at texts and analyze them. You will learn how to read Old English sentences, recite Chaucer in Middle English and read Shakespeare with a 17th century accent. You will discover the reasons why English spelling is irrationally hard; for example, you will understand why the spelling Haus in German makes sense while the spelling house in English does not make sense.Requirements: short homework assignments, two midterm exams and a final exam.Required reading: course pack materials prepared by the instructor.Optional readings: papers on ICON and C.

We shall endeavor to understand how non-European societies were affected by their encounters with Europe, including how colonization was resisted and how the later spread of capitalism and industrialization re-shaped the fabric of vastly different societies. Our journey concludes with an examination of the first and second world wars, looking at their impacts across the globe. A predominant theme will be how imperialism drew nearly all of the world's diverse peoples into its orbit, culminating in the vast destruction of the Second World War, which in turn undid both the European and the Japanese imperial projects. Grading is based upon participation, a presentation and essay on a topic outside Europe and\/or North America, a mid-term and a final exam.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=OvEMRs98oET5VfJX9L6udSeYtXpT9Iue&id=841068&ci=169768"},{"courseID":"IS:2248","name":"The Invention of Writing","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"IS","course_num":2248,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=B0jTmbarpvpRV8C8aZKKmlGWPxZB1Cdo&id=841921&ci=171001"},{"courseID":"IS:2500","name":"Working Internationally                                            Global Business and Communications","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"IS","course_num":2500,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"Change is quickly becoming a permanent fixture in the global business environment\u2014the number of employees embarking on international assignments is increasing, technological advances are speeding the flow of information and innovations throughout the world, and there is a growing awareness that the boundaries of the business world extend beyond national borders. \nAs such, having a global career in some capacity is likely inevitable for most recent graduates.\u00a0 This course will consider global careers through a variety of perspectives.\u00a0 Whether you want to be an entrepreneur or work for a multinational corporation, this course is designed to give you a sense of how you might embark on a global career. \nThis course will feature presentations and panels by professionals in business and communications (including UI alumni) at various stages in their careers.\u00a0 Additional presentations will provide insight into how to search for international internships and jobs, how to prepare tailored resumes and cover letters and how to conduct informational interviews.\nThe active, interactive and reflective components of the course will assist students in identifying and building networks with their peers and with professionals.\u00a0 The course readings and assignments are designed to be applied and used in real life.\nThis course is repeatable up to two times, so students who enrolled in spring 2017 may also enroll in fall 2017.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=V_-YS4R4Y41RV8C8aZKKmvxrZxWWA5Tu&id=841176&ci=169775"},{"courseID":"IS:2570","name":"Introduction to Islamic Psychology","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"IS","course_num":2570,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"View introduction video \n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the emerging field of Islamic Psychology.

Religious economics is a related subject sometimes conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious principles to evaluate economic perspectives and practices. In Economics of Religion, we will draw on these and other emerging areas of inquiry to explore the origins and functions of religious economic ideas in Islamic, Christian, and Jewish societies throughout history.\n\u00a0\nSpecifically, after the financial crisis of 2008, scholars paid more attention to the role of religion in sustaining economic development and inspiring financial institutions to offer religion-compliant products and services. Limits on interest-based loans to the growing Muslim community in Western societies forced many banking and investment organization to create shari`a-compliant products and services. The success of Islamist governments in Turkey and Iran to create thriving middle and entrepreneurial classes brought to focus the relationship between religious belief and economics. Globalization, too, played a significant role in raising the profile of religion-inspired financial endeavors, services, and products. Students will be introduced to these and related themes in this highly multidisciplinary course.\n\u00a0\nThis course is about the origins, functions and impact of Islamic and other religions' ideas and practices in the realms of economic development, financial services and products, business ethics and practices, and business models. Students will explore the ways such ideas and practices affect legacy issues like property rights, poverty, and access to healthcare, education, and social security. Lastly, students will examine the impact of religious ideas and practices on social justice matters that touch on individual and group identity along class, gender, ethnicity, and race, as well as, the role of religion in formulating public policy and directing international relations.

For example we will witness the impact of major events such as the Great Depression and World War II, and we will explore the films\u2019 treatment of gender, race, and ethnicity issues. Featured films will include State Fair, The Music Man, Field of Dreams, The Bridges of Madison County, Cedar Rapids, and more.\nThroughout this course students will be expected to improve their ability to think critically and write at a college-level, as well as gain confidence in small-group discussions. Students will also be introduced to the concepts of visual rhetoric, basic film analysis, and cultural criticism. Grades will be based on class participation and four short writing assignments.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=Y_eHXG06yKLjAB2CBGAMRrgdciy0mWMU&id=852512&ci=151129"},{"courseID":"RHET:1010","name":"Writing for Academic Success","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"RHET","course_num":1010,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"This is a\u00a0twice-a-week tutorial with a writing center tutor scheduled MW or TTh.\u00a0 The tutorial is for inexperienced or apprehensive first-or second-year writers and readers. \u00a0The purpose of the tutorial is to help students enrolled in Rhetoric or General Education Literature with their course work in those or any other courses if students, in consultation with their academic advisors, determine they could benefit from the extra scaffolding and learning the tutorial provides.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nWriting for Academic Success is \u201cgraded\u201d R (attended) or W (didn\u2019t attend).\u00a0 Students will receive an R only if they attend most of the 30 tutorial sessions.

The health (and healing) of the mind and body have always been intertwined in the practices of both medicine and religion.\nThe study of religious healing has become a field of increased visibility in a number of disciplines and subfields in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Psychology, as well is in the field of medical training; indeed, many medical schools today offer courses or programs designed to teach students about the viability of religious or spiritual healing. In this course, we will first examine some of the historical evidence of religious healing, looking at the phenomenon in Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist contexts, as well as in Native American religions and varieties of shamanism. Countless religious and medical texts from all historical periods, as well as ethnographic reports from the last century and a half, exist for all these major religious and healing traditions. In the process of studying this material we will examine notions of science, inquiring into scientific knowledge in cultures with\u00a0a diverse array of dedicated religious and ritual practices, which is to say in cultures that served as the custodians of this healing knowledge. Examination of some of this vast material will occupy approximately half of this course. We will then draw from modern scientific analysis and practice, including the relatively new field of psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI), which studies the relationship between the mind and the immune system, and from academic appraisals of the nexus or religion and healing. The readings will consist of a mix of primary source material, medical reports, and secondary sources. Several relevant ethnographic videos will also be screened.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=nXPN6siGJzBFTkOBjnXURasYcJDpnriZ&id=836553&ci=157555"},{"courseID":"ANTH:3121","name":"Love, Marriage, and Family in India","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ANTH","course_num":3121,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course explores anthropological understandings of love in India and the region of South Asia more broadly, with an emphasis on contemporary society.\u00a0 Marriage, love and sexuality are deeply embedded in kinship organization, caste, economics, politics and religion.\u00a0 Topics include\u00a0filial and motherly love, arranged marriage and romantic love, devotional and artistic expressions, love between siblings.\u00a0 What are the distinctive roles of courtesan, wife, prostitute\u2014and even ascetic women who renounce family and marriage for a life of celibacy?\u00a0 Although patrilineal extended family is often idealized as the traditional way of organizing families in India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries, we will also learn about non-dominant forms of love and family (matrilineal, nuclear, etc.) as well as what it means to be a \u2018modern\u2019 family in South Asia.\nPrerequisite is any introductory course in Anthropology or GWSS, or permission of instructor.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=BEaSSMLbIkFFTkOBjnXURbgdciy0mWMU&id=841221&ci=153805"},{"courseID":"ANTH:3151","name":"Anthro of Beginnings & Ends of Life","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ANTH","course_num":3151,"prereqs":["ANTH:1101","ANTH:2100"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"When does life begin?

Environmental Science has the applied goal of solving environmental problems, drawing upon knowledge in disciplines as diverse as ecology, anthropology, economics, and political science. The specific student learning outcomes for the overall course are:\n\nAbility to critically evaluate popular media articles related to Environmental Science;\nAbility to locate and interpret data relevant to Environmental Science and interpret it;\nUnderstanding the relationship between their day-to-day life and Environmental Science, particularly in the context of sustainability;\nRecognize the multi-faceted nature of Environmental Science.\n\nThis course is taught in a blended environment, including traditional lectures, discussion periods in TILE classrooms, online learning, and both individual and group projects.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=eKHaGnf8MbM14uImvyXy23Am4AbKQSK3&id=834037&ci=154671"},{"courseID":"ENVS:1085","name":"Fundamentals of Environmental Science","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENVS","course_num":1085,"prereqs":[],"hrs":4.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=zJSao3_B72PZ0Hyzu4eAHPxrZxWWA5Tu&id=837283&ci=169989"},{"courseID":"ENVS:1090","name":"Intro to Environmental Sciences Lab","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENVS","course_num":1090,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=pcqKOaEZR8RBCWdJhSZaxfS14lRMWZ5v&id=857254&ci=152327"},{"courseID":"ENVS:1115","name":"Big Ideas: The History & Science of Oil","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENVS","course_num":1115,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n\u00a0\nAs part of the University of Iowa\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the \u201cAge of Petroleum,\u201d an age in which we continue to live.\n\u00a0\nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years? What were the factors behind oil\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth\u2019s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for \u201cHistorical Perspectives,\u201d students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common. Students who enroll in this Courses in Common option will earn Honors credit for the associated Rhetoric course. Students enrolled in both courses will earn Honors credit for this Big Ideas course if they earn a B- or better.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=XxOmGZsJ-9N6KwooggIW0yeYtXpT9Iue&id=836219&ci=169295"},{"courseID":"ENVS:2673","name":"Ecology","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"ENVS","course_num":2673,"prereqs":["BIOL:1411","BIOL:1412","MATH:1460","MATH:1850","MATH:1550"],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Ecology is the study of factors that influence the distribution and abundance of living organisms.

These media interventions don\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible to hole up in a cabin to write a perfect short story anymore, but that the texture of our reality is changing and that our writing can reflect that reality. We\u2019ll discuss how social media platforms, literary journals, self-publishing, Tumblr and other online communities, YouTube, and other innovations have allowed creative people to reach a larger audience and how this has impacted the world of creative writing.\nThis class will run as part laboratory, part salon. The ultimate goal is not for you to walk away feeling like a literary media guru, but for you to improve your creative writing chops and to have a deeper understanding of how the media has changed the face of creative writing. We\u2019ll discuss the political and ethical aspects of new media, read short fiction that pushes the boundaries of form, explore hypertext fiction, watch YouTube shows, analyze Twitter profiles, read online lit journals, and will do much more to develop a deeper understanding of how media affects creative writing today.

This course will look at the human experience of love, loss, and longing across a wide variety of traditions and time periods. The idea will be to glance into a number of literatures without having to identify a single thread or story among them other than our own responses and reflections. This will be an exercise in reading for better living, in learning a bit about how others have thought about love and loss in order to expand our own ways of seeing the world. There won\u2019t be any books to purchase. The readings will be available online. We will work on paying close attention to short texts through simple readings. Our aim will always be to engage the imagination. There will be a series of shorter written assignments, an oral presentation, and a final written project. Some of the readings will be drawn from the likes of Homer, Sappho (the only ancient Greek female poet we know by name), Plato, the anonymous authors of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, the (also anonymous) early Spanish-language texts known as jarchas, the Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus, the Medieval troubadour poets of southern France, Baroque Spanish and Italian verse, and the writings of the great seventeenth-century Mexican nun Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. We\u2019ll think a bit about different kinds of love, what it means to feel so strongly the presence of something that no longer exists or that is far away, about the nature of life, death, joy, sorrow, that sort of thing.

The earliest ones are presented as historical accounts, often intended to teach moral lessons, while the latest are pure fiction, intended to be read for pleasure and entertainment. We will consider questions related to literary form and intent: what is history, what is fiction, and how permeable is the boundary between the real and the fantastic? The major writing assignments for this course will be creative: students will select and rewrite two of the ghost stories we read, perhaps updating the setting to modern times or moving the story from China to Iowa, changing the ending or other plot elements, transforming or adding characters, making a scary story campy or fun, or giving a happy story a tragic ending or vice versa, and write an essay discussing the changes.

From Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Patsy Cline, Janis Joplin, Chrissie Hynde and Patti Smith to Madonna, the Spice Girls, Alanis Morissette, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Pink, Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele, female performers have challenged and redefined the manner in which the music industry and fans respond to issues of gender, sexuality, identity, authenticity, and artistry. In this course students examine the history of popular women musicians and the influence their lyrics, music and performances have had on American and British culture. Concurrently students explore the impact which civil rights, the British Invasion (i.e. the Beatles and the Rolling Stones), second wave feminism, the counterculture, social injustices, war, music education, rock festivals and charity concerts have had on women\u2019s music careers.\nOur exploration cuts across cultures and ethnicity as we analyze the rise and fall of early girl groups such as the Shirelles, the Supremes, and the Ronettes, the dynamics of mixed gender groups including The Mamas and the Papas, Fleetwood Mac, Blondie, and Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees, and the social lyricism of Joan Baez, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, Suzanne Vega, and Tracy Chapman. Through the lens of female performers\u2019 unfamiliarity with their precursors, the construction of canon will be critiqued.If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may

Principles explored in this course will be: \u00a0The poise of the head in fluid relationship to the spine; \u00a0responses to gravity; developing sensory awareness and understanding the process of change; \u00a0conscious use of of energy and direction to support natural phrasing; \"body mapping\" and experiential anatomy to clarify how movement takes place most easily. Physical participation in this studio course will include lying down, rolling, sitting, standing, locomotion and your skilled activity. \u00a0Alexander Technique is most often taught through light touch, thinking and visualization: \u00a0Students will learn some principles of listening to information from their hands through touch, and how to learn through the kinesthetic information supplied by touch. \u00a0Work outside of class time will include a journal, observations, and take-home questions. \u00a0Students will be expected to practice daily and explore the use of the principles learned with their specific performance area or in service of other unique goals.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=JgSEXnKR6buncyhXjeu2f-rnvO0vVbdX&id=851718&ci=157769"},{"courseID":"MUS:3990","name":"Special Studies","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":3990,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=0avt9KtsPoincyhXjeu2f2Rdsvd8NL9m&id=830830&ci=147383"},{"courseID":"MUS:4200","name":"Counterpoint Before 1600","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":4200,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Two- and three-part counterpoint: \u00a0Renaissance polyphony.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=ucLvRc9qMFyncyhXjeu2fzOkknQ0jZgB&id=830794&ci=147355"},{"courseID":"MUS:4201","name":"Counterpoint After 1600","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":4201,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=aS97NO7nBH7xiX_7IGIpJSLNcIFn7jMF&id=837477&ci=147357"},{"courseID":"MUS:4210","name":"Keyboard Harmony","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":4210,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"Melody harmonization and figured-bass realization at the keyboard.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=OiBeQ3PEw93xiX_7IGIpJQjgExJAf2fj&id=830796&ci=147360"},{"courseID":"MUS:4250","name":"Composition: Electronic Media I","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":4250,"prereqs":[],"hrs":3.0,"Description":"Composition using analog, digital technology.\u00a0 Offered fall semesters.","Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=Xp1nX9Zg32Qinmx8qvI5Q141ufakJzRM&id=830845&ci=147415"},{"courseID":"MUS:4452","name":"Liturgics","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":4452,"prereqs":[],"hrs":2.0,"Description":null,"Link":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=J3fJN0MODn4inmx8qvI5Qx01o3BB_hSW&id=852856&ci=154817"},{"courseID":"MUS:4670","name":"Internship in Music Therapy","college":"College of Liberal Arts and Sciences","department":"MUS","course_num":4670,"prereqs":[],"hrs":1.0,"Description":"This field experience (1,040 hours) follows completion of all academic course work for the music therapy major and fulfills a requirement for registration by the American Music Therapy Association.
